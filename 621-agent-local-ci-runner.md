# 621 — Renamed

This backlog doc was renamed/rewritten to reflect the new canonical entrypoint:

- `backlog/621-ameide-cli-inner-loop-test.md`

Legacy bash runner scripts (`tools/dev/agent-local-ci/**`) remain in-tree for reference, but the authoritative deliverable for 621 is now the Go CLI command:

- `ameide test`

Historical note: this was previously shipped as `ameide dev inner-loop-test`.
