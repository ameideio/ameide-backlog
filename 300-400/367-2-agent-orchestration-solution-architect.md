# backlog/367-2-agent-orchestration-solution-architect – Solution/Program-Level Automation

**Parent backlog:** [backlog/367-elements-transformation-automation.md](./367-elements-transformation-automation.md)

## Purpose
Adapt automation to Solution Architect or program-level roles (e.g., SAFe Solution/ART architects) who coordinate design decisions across teams, manage cross-repo impacts, and prepare technical governance artifacts.

## Scope
- Agent profiles focused on solution intents, non-functional requirements, dependency mapping, and integration plans.
- Multi-repo adapters to inspect APIs, contracts, infrastructure IaC, and generate impact analyses / architecture decision records.
- Workflow integration with dependency boards (SAFe) or cross-team planning ceremonies; ability to attach outputs to shared dependency records so Scrum/SAFe views share the same data without a shared neutral layer.
- Evidence packaging for Solution Demo/System Demo (integration test runs, deployment diagrams, contract test reports) registered as `governance.v1.Attestation` entries tied to PI Objectives / Timeboxes.
- Escalation/comms hooks (notify teams, file impediments) when agent detects blocking dependencies or missing capabilities.

## Deliverables
1. **Agent definitions** – Playbooks for generating solution designs, integration plans, ADRs, dependency matrices.
2. **Adapters/scripts** – Tools to diff shared libraries/APIs, run contract tests, validate compatibility across services.
3. **UI tie-ins** – Surface agent-generated dependency insights on PI planning boards and iteration dashboards.
4. **Telemetry** – Track resolved dependencies, integration coverage, lead time on cross-team issues, and impediments raised/resolved by the agent.

## Non-goals
- Code-level branch/PR automation (coding agent) or TOGAF deliverables (EA agent).

## Dependencies
- Methodology profile referencing solution-level roles (e.g., SAFe Solution Train, cross-team dependencies).
- Generic scheduler + multi-repo support.
- Canonical element/relationship storage from [backlog/300-ameide-metamodel.md](./300-ameide-metamodel.md) for dependency graphs and ADRs.

## Exit Criteria
- Solution Architects can trigger automation to produce integration plans, highlight dependencies, and validate contracts, with outputs feeding PI/Solution demos.
- Dependency risks generated by agents automatically appear on planning boards with mitigation steps.

## Implementation guide
- **Agent definition**: implement LangGraph plans that inspect APIs/contracts/IaC, generate ADRs and dependency matrices, and emit dependency updates/attestations via the shared governance APIs.
- **Proto/contracts**: add/update Buf proto messages for dependencies, ADR metadata, and notifications; regenerate SDKs consumed by UI/planner.
- **Tooling**: build multi-repo adapters (contract tests, API diffing) with guardrails.
- **UI integration**: show agent-generated dependencies on PI/Sprint boards; allow mitigation assignments.
- **Telemetry**: metrics on dependency resolution time, integration coverage, impediments raised/resolved.
