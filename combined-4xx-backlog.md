# Agentic Development Workflow

## Goal
Consistently develop on the `dev` branch, land changes via PR into `main`, and keep your local environment clean by resetting `dev` to the tracked `origin/main` after each merge.

## Working in `dev`
- Always branch from a clean `dev` that tracks `origin/main`.
  - `git checkout dev && git pull --rebase`
- Keep the working tree clean; avoid lingering changes across tasks.
- Assume `gh` CLI is authenticated, `argocd` CLI is authenticated, and Tilt is running on port `10350`; do not restart existing services without explicit authorization.

## Implement & Test
- Make changes on `dev`. Run the relevant workspace test suites (Go, TS, Py) before committing.
- Keep commits focused; avoid mixing unrelated changes.

## Commit & Push
- Commit to `dev`: `git commit -am "<message>"` (or stage explicitly).
- Push `dev`: `git push origin dev`.

## Open PR to `main`
- Create PR from `dev` → `main` **only when requested/approved** (e.g., `gh pr create --base main --head dev`).
- CI should run; address failures on `dev`, then push again.

## Merge
- Merge via PR (squash preferred) with branch protection on `main`.
- After merge, delete remote PR branch if desired.

## Reset local `dev` to continue
- Sync `main`: `git checkout main && git pull --rebase`.
- Recreate a fresh `dev` from `origin/main`:
  - `git checkout -B dev origin/main`
  - `git push origin dev` (fast-forward) if you keep `dev` published.
- Confirm clean state: `git status` should be empty.

## Hygiene & Recovery
- Never develop directly on `main` (protected).
- If a rebase is interrupted, `git rebase --abort` to reset; ensure `git status` shows no rebasing note.
- Use `git reflog` to recover lost work; create a rescue branch (`git branch rescue/<date> <sha>`) if needed.
- Avoid local `go.work`/`replace` changes in commits; reset to repository defaults before push.

## CI Expectations
- PRs must be green (unit/integration as configured) before merge.
- Docker/SDK workflows may require registry creds; keep secrets configured in repo settings.

## 401-ameide-vision.md

# 401 – Ameide Vision (Current State, MECE)
**Status:** Draft (2025-11-23)  
**Intent:** Provide a MECE snapshot of what Ameide delivers today, anchored in shipped services, SDKs, guardrails, and pipelines. This is the “reality layer” to contrast with forward-looking scenarios.

> ⚠️ **Remote-first update:** Delivery and DevContainer sections below describe the legacy k3d-based workflow (local registry + Argo bootstrap). The current source of truth for remote-first development is [435-remote-first-development.md](435-remote-first-development.md); treat any k3d references here as historical context.

## 1) Data & Governance Plane (metamodel, org, transformation)
- **Graph/Repository (knowledge system):** `services/graph` and `services/repository` expose CRUD + version history over the unified metamodel via Connect/gRPC, backed by Postgres with Flyway, pg-mem unit tests, and Testcontainers e2e (`services/graph/README.md`, `services/repository/README.md`). Repository dual-writes metadata + elements; Graph hosts the element/relationship handlers.
- **Platform (org/teams/roles):** `services/platform` serves `ameide_core_proto.platform.v1` for organizations, teams, roles, users, invitations (`services/platform/README.md`). Tilt/Helm deploy with Vault-managed DB creds.
- **Transformation (governance/runtime):** `services/transformation` runs lifecycle APIs (initiatives → transformations, stages, milestones, metrics) and projects runtime facts back into the graph (`services/transformation/README.md`). It is the execution plane for methodologies and role maps.
- **Workflows (orchestration surface):** `services/workflows` provides the gRPC workflow API; Python workers (`services/workflows_runtime`, `services/workflow_worker`) execute Temporal workflows with strict `TEMPORAL_*` env validation and integration tests against Temporal test servers (`services/workflows_runtime/README.md`).
- **Guardrails:** Charts require ExternalSecrets for DB access (Vault), db-migration hooks fail fast, and `infra/kubernetes/scripts/validate-hardened-charts.sh` renders overlays in CI (referenced across service READMEs).

## 2) Agentic & AI Plane
- **Agents control plane:** `services/agents` (Go) stores node definitions and tenant-scoped agents, supports catalog streaming of node snapshots, routing simulation, and MinIO-backed artifact uploads (LangGraph compilation TODO). gRPC surface: `ameide_core_proto.agents.v1` (`services/agents/README.md`).
- **Inference runtimes:**  
  - **Inference Service (Python):** LangGraph + FastAPI SSE/WS with OpenAI + Langfuse integration (`services/inference/README.md`). Currently still uses raw `ameide_core_proto` stubs for some calls (gap noted in 393/389).  
- **Agents Runtime (Python “Inference v2”):** Hydrates agents from the Agents service over gRPC, evaluates declarative routes, streams responses; falls back to plan-driven stub when no LLM configured (`services/agents_runtime/README.md`).  
  - **Inference Gateway (Go):** Connect/gRPC-Web entry, auth, rate limiting, optional Redis buffering, protocol translation to inference runtime (`services/inference_gateway/README.md`).
- **Conversation storage:** `services/chat` and `services/threads` persist conversations/threads in Postgres and delegate generation to inference (`services/chat/README.md`, `services/threads/README.md`).
- **Runtime workers:** Temporal workers (`workflows_runtime`, `workflow_worker`) execute orchestration tasks and callbacks.
- **Artifacts & storage:** MinIO for compiled agent artifacts (`services/agents/README.md`), Redis optional in inference-gateway for buffering, Postgres for state across services.

## 3) SDKs, Contracts, and Clients
- **Single proto source:** `packages/ameide_core_proto` is the committed schema and generated bundle; services import it for dev/test (`backlog/393-ameide-sdk-import-policy.md`).
- **SDK surfaces:** TS (`packages/ameide_sdk_ts`), Go (`packages/ameide_sdk_go` / `github.com/ameideio/ameide-sdk-go`), Python (`packages/ameide_sdk_python`) wrap transports, auth, retries, tracing, and export proto types at runtime.
- **AmeideClient contract:** Unified option defaults, metadata/auth/timeout/retry/tracing interceptors, request ID injection, and helper factories are defined and tested via manifest (`sdk/manifest/ameide-client.json`, `backlog/389-ameide-sdk-ameideclient.md`). TS/Go/Python implementations now align; integration coverage still evolving.
- **Import policy guardrails:** Runtime code must consume SDKs; tests may import the proto bundle. Guard scripts enforce no `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts/proto.js` imports, forbid Go `replace` hacks, and check lock hygiene (`scripts/policy/run_all.sh`), see `backlog/393-ameide-sdk-import-policy.md`.
- **Current publish status (evidence from 388/390):** Go SDK tagged `v0.1.0` with GHCR aliases; Python SDK on PyPI (`2.10.1`) but GHCR lacks SemVer tags; TS SDK not on npmjs and GHCR only carries dev/hash; configuration package lacks SemVer tags (`backlog/388-ameide-sdks-north-star.md`, `backlog/390-ameide-sdk-versioning.md`).

## 4) Frontend & UX Plane
- **Authenticated platform:** `services/www_ameide_platform` (Next.js) with Keycloak SSO via NextAuth v5, Redis-backed sessions, seeded personas, and Playwright e2e suites for auth/token/role flows (`services/www_ameide_platform/README.md`). Uses SDK clients via local proto barrel for dev/test.
- **Public portal:** `services/www_ameide` provides marketing/docs and redirects to the platform entrypoint; uses SDK proto barrel for dev/test, no auth (`services/www_ameide/README.md`).
- **Proto clients in UI:** Both apps re-export proto namespaces and SDK clients from `src/proto` shims; no Buf/Verdaccio dependencies remain (per import policy).

## 5) Delivery, Ops, and Guardrails
- **GitOps & bootstrap:** Argo CD (single control plane in the `argocd` namespace) reconciles every namespace (`ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod`). DevContainers now only hydrate tooling (`pnpm`, Azure CLI, kubelogin, Telepresence) and fetch AKS credentials; there is no local k3d bootstrap. Tilt handles the inner loop by deploying the `*-tilt` releases and Telepresence routes cluster traffic back to the local dev process (`README.md`, `backlog/435-remote-first-development.md`).
- **Ingress & TLS:** Envoy Gateway remains the sole TLS terminator. Wildcard DNS for `*.dev.ameide.io` plus the Telepresence-only `*.local.ameide.io` listener is managed under `.devcontainer/` (`README.md`, `backlog/417-envoy-route-tracking.md`).
- **Secrets & compliance:** ExternalSecrets + Vault are mandatory; charts fail without `existingSecret` references. db-migration hooks and `infra/kubernetes/scripts/validate-hardened-charts.sh` enforce credentials and template validity (called out in service READMEs).
- **Build & images:** BuildKit scripts under `build/scripts/` produce OCI images; service Dockerfiles copy `pnpm-lock.yaml` before frozen installs to pin deps (documented in per-service READMEs and policy in 393). Helm/Argo use image tags from publishes; GitOps repo lives at `gitops/ameide-gitops` (nested).

## 6) Release, Versioning, and Artifacts
- **Authority:** Git tags `vX.Y.Z` drive release versions; non-tag builds use dev/snapshot versions (`backlog/390-ameide-sdk-versioning.md`).
- **Pipeline:** `.github/workflows/cd-packages.yml` computes versions, builds/tests TS/Go/Python/config, publishes to npm/PyPI/GHCR, and signs SHA tags (blueprint in `backlog/388-ameide-sdks-north-star.md`).
- **State of play:** Go SDK aligned (repo + GHCR aliases). TS SDK missing public SemVer publish; GHCR TS/Python/Configuration lack SemVer/`latest` aliases. Lock hygiene scripts exist but CI still runs TS services against workspace links; inference service still bypasses SDK in places (gaps in 388/393).

## 7) Observability, Security, Compliance
- **Tracing & metrics:** SDKs emit tracing metadata; Go SDK uses otelgrpc; TS/Python tracing interceptors aligned per manifest (`backlog/389-ameide-sdk-ameideclient.md`). Langfuse wired in inference runtime (`services/inference/README.md`). ClickHouse dependency noted for data plane in GitOps (`README.md`).
- **Health & readiness:** HTTP/Connect/gRPC health endpoints standardized across services (examples in `services/README.md` and service-specific READMEs).
- **Auth & identity:** Keycloak realms managed via onboarding; platform app handles auth/SSO; Redis sessions; Backchannel logout and token storage documented in `services/www_ameide_platform/README.md`. No separate governance service yet; policy is via Git/PR.

## 8) Gaps vs the long-term vision
- **Catalog/governance plane absent:** No tenant-facing service catalog, feature specs, or risk-tiered governance engine. Change control is Git/PR + Helm/Argo guardrails, not policy-aware automation.
- **Agent pipeline maturity:** Agents service streams node snapshots only; compiled LangGraph artifact publishing and deployment flow are TODO. Inference service still uses raw proto stubs instead of SDK clients; stub fallback remains default when no LLM configured.
- **SDK distribution gaps:** TS SDK not published to npmjs; GHCR missing SemVer aliases for TS/Python/Configuration; CI still leans on workspace links rather than published tarballs for TS.
- **Preview/promotion flow:** Preview environments exist via Tilt/Argo patterns but not tied to tenant-scoped feature sets or governance checks; no “feature spec” pipeline.
- **Telemetry depth:** Tracing exists at SDK layer; service-level metrics/OTel coverage uneven; ClickHouse noted but not fully described here.

## Where to look next (evidence map)
- **Service capabilities:** `services/**/README.md` (Graph, Repository, Platform, Transformation, Workflows, Agents, Agents Runtime, Inference, Inference Gateway, Chat, Threads, www_ameide_platform, www_ameide).
- **SDK policy & client contract:** `backlog/393-ameide-sdk-import-policy.md`, `backlog/389-ameide-sdk-ameideclient.md`, `sdk/manifest/ameide-client.json`.
- **Versioning & publishing:** `backlog/388-ameide-sdks-north-star.md`, `backlog/390-ameide-sdk-versioning.md`, `.github/workflows/cd-packages.yml`.
- **Ops/bootstrapping:** `README.md`, `.devcontainer/postCreate.sh`, `tools/bootstrap/bootstrap-v2.sh`, `infra/kubernetes/scripts/validate-hardened-charts.sh`, `build/scripts/*`.

## 402-buf-first-generated-clients.md

You’re not wrong to feel the approach has been flipping a bit. What you’re asking for is actually pretty crisp:

> **SDKs are product artifacts. Internal services should sit “on top of” protos, not “behind” SDK publishing. When I change a proto, my services should break *immediately* in dev/CI without waiting on cd‑packages or registry publishes.**
>
> **Dev and CI both use Buf-generated stubs emitted into the SDK packages (TS/Go/Py) from `packages/ameide_core_proto`; services consume the SDK surface only. Published SDK artifacts are for external consumers and out-of-tree smoke validation.**

You can absolutely have that **and** keep Ameide SDKs as products. It just means tightening the layering and being explicit about two paths:

* **Inner loop / internal services** → proto‑first, workspace‑only.
* **Outer loop / external consumers** → SDK‑as‑product, versioned, published.

**Fast map (rings ↔ builds):**

| Ring | Who | Inputs in builds | Registry requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `packages/ameide_core_proto` | Buf CLI, committed stubs, generated into SDK packages | Buf for plugins only |
| 1 | Services / PR CI / Tilt / dev images built in-repo | Workspace SDK packages (with generated stubs) + AmeideClient (TS/Go/Py) | None |
| 2 | Prod/staging service images built in-repo | Workspace SDK packages (with generated stubs) + AmeideClient; strict third-party locks | None |
| SDK product track | External consumers + publish smoke | Published SDKs (`@ameideio/…`, `ameide-sdk-*`) | npm/PyPI/Go module |

Naming note for this repo: every `Dockerfile.dev` implements Ring 1 (workspace-first dev/Tilt images), while the `Dockerfile.release` files implement Ring 2 (workspace SDKs, strict third-party locks; no Ameide packages pulled from registries). The SDK publish/smoke path is separate from these rings.

Related: backlog/388 (SDKs as products), backlog/390 (tag authority), backlog/393 (old import policy; superseded for Ring 1 by this doc + 403/404/405).

Below is how I’d shape that, in terms of architecture and what to tweak in the existing docs.

---

## 1. Core principle: two rings around the protos

Let’s define clear rings:

1. **Ring 0 – Schema (protos)**

   * `packages/ameide_core_proto` is the single schema module. Buf generates TS/Go/Py stubs directly into the SDK packages (including buf/validate).

2. **Ring 1 – Internal consumers (services, tests, tools)**

   * Services depend on the SDK proto surface only (TS/Go/Py) inside the monorepo.
   * When you change a proto and rebuild core_proto → SDKs, TS typecheck / `go build` / Python tests break immediately.
   * No external registry, no `cd-packages`, no published SDKs in this feedback loop.

3. **Ring 2 – Workspace-first prod/staging images**

   * Same imports as Ring 1, resolved to workspace SDK packages (copied/vendor in Dockerfiles), with strict locking for third-party deps.
   * No Ameide packages are pulled from registries in these images; they still break on proto drift without waiting for publishes.

4. **SDK product track (outer loop)**

   * `cd-packages` builds and publishes the SDKs for external consumers and runs out-of-tree smoke tests. This is not a ring for service images.

Rule of thumb:

> **Code imports proto/clients from the SDK barrels (`@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts/proto.js`, `github.com/ameideio/ameide-sdk-go/gen/...`, `ameide_core_proto.*` from the Python SDK package). Rings 1 and 2 resolve those to workspace SDK packages; published SDKs are only for the outer-loop smoke and external consumers. Stubs are synced into SDKs from the BSR module (see 410 – BSR-native SDKs); services never import BSR stub packages directly.**

---

## 2. What this means concretely per language

### TypeScript

**Today (per 393):**

* Dev/tests: services import types from `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts/proto.js` but resolution often pointed straight at `packages/ameide_core_proto/dist/src/index.js`.
* Runtime: services are supposed to get Connect clients from `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts` (AmeideClient).
* CI/Docker guardrails try to force published SDK consumption, which is where you’re feeling pain.

**Adjusted model:**

* **Inner loop / CI on PRs:**

  * Services import **types + clients** from `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts/proto.js` (and SDK entrypoints). In Ring 1 this resolves to the **workspace** SDK build that already contains the generated stubs (buf/validate included).
  * No requirement that `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts` exists on npm / GHCR to get a passing build.
  * Breaking proto change → `pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto build` (emits into SDK) → services fail typecheck or tests immediately.

* **Outer loop / release:**

  * `cd-packages` stamps `NPM_VERSION`, runs tests for `packages/ameide_sdk_ts`, and **publishes** it as `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts@X.Y.Z` using the SemVer scheme from 388/390.
  * Smoketests install it out of tree.
  * External consumers use the published package; internal services still use workspace.

Key tweak to docs: 393 should make clear the SDK surface is the only import path for services; resolution is to workspace SDKs in Rings 1/2 and to published artifacts only in the SDK product track.

---

### Go

**Today (docs vs reality conflict):**

* 388/390/393 say: Go services depend on `github.com/ameideio/ameide-sdk-go`, using tags/pseudo‑versions; CI/Docker set `GOWORK=off` and must not use replaces.
* 393 also mentions **Option A** from Buf: consume generated stubs via `buf.build/gen/go/...` with `go get`, no local caches. 
* You’ve bounced between those two, which is exactly the confusion you’re feeling.

**Adjusted model:**

* **Inner loop / PR CI:**

  * `go.work` maps `./packages/ameide_sdk_go` into the workspace (with stubs generated into the SDK tree).
  * Services import AmeideClient + stubs from the SDK module via `go.work`, not `packages/ameide_core_proto` paths.
  * `go build ./...` fails immediately when a proto change breaks a service—no `go get` from GitHub, no Buf registry dependency in this loop.

* **Outer loop / release:**

  * `cd-packages` tags and publishes `github.com/ameideio/ameide-sdk-go` at `vX.Y.Z` per 388/390.
  * Release validation and smoke tests use `GOWORK=off` + `go get github.com/ameideio/ameide-sdk-go@vX.Y.Z`.
  * External consumers use that module; internal services don’t care whether this publish has happened to keep iterating.

So Go gets the same story as TS:

> **Workspace AmeideClient + local stubs for dev/CI; tagged `ameide-sdk-go` for external consumers and release tests.**

Buf’s Option A (`go get buf.build/gen/go/...`) still applies as the underlying stub source; the only difference is *where* you add the AmeideClient layer and who is forced to use the published module.

---

### Python

**Adjusted model mirrors TS/Go:**

* Inner loop / PR CI:

  * `uv` installs the workspace `ameide_sdk_python` (with generated stubs) in editable mode.
  * Services import stubs from `ameide_sdk.proto.*` only; no `ameide_core_proto` alias.
  * Breaking proto change → tests break immediately.

* Outer loop / release:

  * `cd-packages` stamps `PYPI_VERSION`, builds/publishes `ameide-sdk-python`, and updates GHCR artifacts as in 388/390.
  * External consumers use the PyPI wheel; your release smoke tests ensure it still matches the current protos.

---

## 3. How this hits the “immediate error, no noise” requirement

With that split:

* **Proto change workflow becomes:**

  1. Edit `.proto` in `packages/ameide_core_proto`.
  2. Run `pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto build` (local Buf generate + TS build; Go/Py codegen lives here too).
  3. Run your normal inner-loop checks (`pnpm test`, `go test ./...`, `uv run pytest`).

* Any service that:

  * imports a type that no longer exists,
  * relies on a field that changed type,
  * expects a method that was renamed,

  will **fail immediately** in the workspace build.

No `cd-packages`, no npm/PyPI/Go module publish, no Buf/BSR network round‑trips are required to see those errors.

The SDKs (as products) are **agnostic** to that inner loop:

* They’re just libraries in `packages/ameide_sdk_*` that you optionally build/run tests for.
* Publishing them is an outer‑loop concern (tag + `cd-packages`), not a prerequisite for making internal services compile.

That’s exactly the property you described.

---

## 4. What you should tweak in the docs to reflect this

To make this consistent and stop the flip‑flop, I’d explicitly change the docs like this:

### 388 – SDKs North Star 

* Keep it as the **“SDKs as products” doc**.
* Add a short note up top:

  > “This document describes how we version and publish the TS/Go/Py SDK *as artifacts* for external consumers and release validation. Internal services in the monorepo consume the SDK proto surface from the workspace SDK packages (generated from `packages/ameide_core_proto`); they are not required to consume published artifacts.”

### 389 – AmeideClient Parity 

* Clarify that the AmeideClient contract applies to:

  * the internal AmeideClient implementations in the repo,
  * and the SDKs that package them.
* Remove or soften any language that says “all services must consume the *published* SDK”; instead say “all clients of the platform (internal or external) must respect this API, but monorepo services may link the workspace implementation.”

### 390 – Versioning alignment 

* Make it explicit that:

  * **PR/branch CI** uses workspace dependencies only (no requirement to hit npm/PyPI/Go module registries).
  * The tag‑driven publish + SemVer model applies to **external SDK distribution and release images**, not to inner‑loop builds.

### 393 – SDK Import & Proto Consumption Policy 

This is the biggest one to tweak:

* Change the strong global statement:

  > “Runtime consumers never link the raw stubs directly; they import `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts`, `ameide-sdk-go`, or `ameide-sdk-python`.”

  into something like:

  > “**External** runtime consumers and SDK publish smoke use `ameide-sdk-*` as the public surface from registries.
  > **Internal** monorepo services (dev, PR CI, prod images built in-repo) consume the SDK proto surface from workspace SDK packages so proto changes fail fast without waiting for SDK publishes.”

* Keep the “one proto source” and “Buf outputs land in SDK packages” parts as‑is (they already give you the immediate‑error property).

* Narrow the Docker/CI rules so:
  * **Dev/Tilt** images use workspace SDK packages.
  * **Prod** images (built by `cd-service-images`) also copy/vendor workspace SDK packages; published SDKs are validated only in the SDK product track.

---

## 5. Sanity check against Buf/BSR

This is actually very close to Buf’s own story:

* Buf wants one schema module, codegen from that, and then:

  * internal consumers often use generated stubs directly;
  * vendors sometimes wrap those stubs in higher‑level SDKs for external use. 

You’re basically saying:

* **Follow Buf for internal dev** (schema‑first, stubs generated into SDK packages, immediate feedback).
* **Add a vendor‑style AmeideClient SDK layer for external consumers**, but treat it as product packaging in the SDK publish track, not as a prerequisite for internal service builds.

That’s a sane, vendor‑aligned split.

## 403-python-buf-first-migration-plan.md

# 403 – Python Buf-first migration plan

**Status:** Draft  
**Intent:** Apply the buf-first/client-gen model from 402 to every Python service so proto edits break builds immediately (workspace stubs) across dev/CI/prod; SDKs still publish for external consumers but Ameide images build from repo protos/SDK code. One `uv.lock` stays canonical; CI/dev/prod choose workspace editables vs frozen wheel via install mode, not by carrying two locks. Version pins track the tag authority from backlog/390.

## Context
- 402 requires proto-first for all rings (dev/CI/prod). Prod images must build from the repo proto outputs + SDK code, not from published wheels.
- Python services pin `ameide-sdk-python==2.10.1` in `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`; guardrails enforce PyPI-only. That delays “proto change → service break” until a publish.
- Scope: `services/inference`, `services/agents_runtime`, `services/workflows_runtime`, `services/workflow_worker`.
- Gaps: inference still builds stubs/transports manually; dev/Tilt/CI/prod install the published wheel instead of the workspace SDK; no guard that buf regen ran before Python tests.
- **Same imports, different source**: Python code should be identical across rings; Ring 1 resolves editable workspace proto/SDK, Ring 2 uses the pinned wheel version in `uv.lock`.

**Naming:** when this doc says “dev/Tilt Dockerfile”, it means `Dockerfile.dev` (Ring 1, workspace stubs/SDK). “Prod/CI Dockerfile” refers to the plain `Dockerfile` (Ring 2, stamped lockfile + published wheel).

## Plan

**Phase 0 – Prereqs / plumbing**
- Add workspace sources for Python in `tool.uv.sources` (or env toggle) so `uv sync` installs `packages/ameide_sdk_python` (with generated stubs) editable for all modes (dev/CI/prod); services do not import `packages/ameide_core_proto` directly.
- Update `scripts/ci/prepare_python_env.sh` and Tilt Python resources to run the editable installs after `pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto build` so regenerated stubs are what tests see.
- Adjust `scripts/policy/check_lock_hygiene.sh` to allow/expect workspace sources (drop PyPI-only enforcement); tighten drift checks instead.
- Ensure `packages/ameide_core_proto/buf.gen.sdk-python.yaml` regeneration is part of the standard proto build (already emits to `packages/ameide_sdk_python/src/ameide_sdk/generated`); add a CI check that fails if manifests drift.

**Phase 1 – CI/build flow**
- `ci-core-quality` (dev + PR CI): run `pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto build`, install editable `ameide_sdk_python`, and execute a smoke pytest over SDK interceptors to prove the workspace build is used (no PyPI required).
- Add a guard that a proto diff without regenerated Python outputs fails CI (reuse `scripts/dev/check_sdk_alignment.py` or a Python-specific variant).
- For release workflows (`cd-packages`, `cd-service-images`), build images against the workspace proto/SDK (copied into the build context). Still publish and smoke-install the wheel for external consumers, but Ameide images do not depend on it.

**Phase 2 – Service migrations (single path: proto → workspace SDK → image)**
- `services/agents_runtime`  
  - Switch `pyproject.toml` to workspace sources for `ameide-sdk-python` only.  
  - Update Dockerfile.dev/prod/Tilt to copy `packages/ameide_sdk_python` and install editable after sync (no PyPI stamping).  
  - Add an SDK-backed metadata/auth/retry/timeout integration test that asserts headers and deadlines survive through the AmeideClient wrappers.
- `services/workflows_runtime` and `services/workflow_worker`  
  - Same dependency swap + Dockerfile changes; keep Temporal callbacks on the SDK clients.  
  - Add coverage that callback clients still inject tenant/source metadata via AmeideClient interceptors.
- `services/inference`  
  - Replace direct `grpc_aio.server` + raw stubs usage with AmeideClient-based clients (reuse retry/metadata/tracing helpers from `ameide_sdk`).  
  - Wire SDK config (addr/auth/tenant/request-id/timeouts) from env; add integration tests for headers/retries/timeouts/tracing via the SDK.  
  - Ensure proto imports come from `ameide_core_proto.*` (via the SDK package) so proto edits break tests without a publish; SDK stubs are synced from the BSR module (not generated in services).

**Phase 3 – Locks & artifacts**
- Single path: `uv.lock` records workspace sources for Ameide SDK; no separate release lock. Ameide images build from repo sources.
- Update `scripts/policy/check_docker_sources.sh` to permit/expect workspace SDK copies in Dockerfiles and fail on core_proto copies.
- Keep release provenance for external consumers: `cd-packages` still stamps/labels `ameide-sdk-python`, builds the wheel, and smoke-installs it out-of-tree, but Ameide services/images do not depend on the published wheel.

**Phase 4 – Acceptance gates**
- Proto change breaks Python service tests without publishing an SDK.
- Devcontainer/Tilt/prod images all use workspace proto/SDK sources.
- CI enforces regenerated Python outputs and rejects stale manifests.
- SDK parity tests (metadata/auth/retry/timeout/tracing/request-id) run in CI for all Python services and the SDK itself.

## Progress (2025-11-24)
- [x] CI scripts install workspace proto/SDK (editable) after `pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto build` (`scripts/ci/install_python_workspace_sdks.sh`, `scripts/ci/prepare_python_env.sh`, wired into `ci-core-quality`).
- [x] Guardrails updated to allow/expect workspace proto/SDK in Docker/locks (`scripts/policy/check_lock_hygiene.sh`, `scripts/policy/check_docker_sources.sh`).
- [x] Agents runtime switched to proto-first across dev/prod: `pyproject.toml` now uses `tool.uv.sources` for `ameide-sdk-python`; Dockerfiles copy `packages/ameide_sdk_python` and drop SDK stamping; `uv.lock` refreshed to workspace SDK.
- [x] Workflows_runtime and workflow_worker now install workspace proto/SDK (uv sources + editable) in pyproject/Dockerfiles; Temporal callbacks still run through AmeideClient.
- [x] Inference pyproject/Dockerfile now consume workspace proto/SDK (uv sources + editable install) so proto changes break builds; service still uses raw stubs and needs AmeideClient + header/retry/tracing coverage.
- [ ] Add proto/SDK drift check before Python tests (fail CI on unstamped regen).
- [ ] Complete inference refactor onto AmeideClient and add SDK header/retry/timeout/tracing tests.

## Rollout order
1) Land plumbing: uv source overrides + CI job to regen/install workspace SDK.  
2) Update guardrail scripts (lock hygiene, docker source) for the single-path model.  
3) Migrate agents_runtime + workflows_runtime/workflow_worker to workspace dependencies and add their SDK header/retry tests.  
4) Refactor inference onto AmeideClient + add SDK integration tests.  
5) Add proto/manifest drift enforcement to `cd-packages`/`cd-service-images` and flip CI to fail on proto drift.

## Problem
- 402/407/408 require services to consume protos only through the SDK surface, with Buf outputs emitted into the SDK packages (synced from the BSR module); guardrails still force published `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts`/npm.pkg in Ring 2.
- Proto edits do not reliably break TS services until the SDK publish path runs; PR CI and Tilt carry npm/pkg auth and Buf registry coupling that slows iteration.
- Policy runner (`scripts/policy/run_all.sh`, including Docker checks) enforces the SDK-only stance; keep it aligned to the proto-first rings.

## Goal
- Inner loop + PR CI (dev and CI): TS services import a single surface (`@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts/proto.js` + SDK entrypoints) resolved to the **workspace** SDK that already contains Buf outputs (including buf/validate) synced from BSR; proto changes break typecheck/tests immediately without any registry access.
- Ring 2 prod/staging images: built from the same workspace SDK (copied into Dockerfile.release) with strict third-party locks; no `packages/ameide_core_proto` copies and no npm/pkg fetch of Ameide packages.
- Outer loop: `cd-packages` still publishes `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts` for external consumers and out-of-tree smoke tests; release images in-repo do not depend on the publish.
- One AmeideClient contract (389) remains the runtime surface; only the dependency resolution changes.
- **Same imports, same source** for services: both rings resolve to workspace SDK packages; the published artifact is only used in the SDK product track.
- Supersedes backlog/393 for Rings 1/2 (dev/Tilt/PR CI/prod images built in-repo). 393 remains relevant for the SDK publish track (external consumers + smoke).

**File mapping reminder:** `Dockerfile.dev` == Ring 1 (workspace SDK, Tilt/dev containers). `Dockerfile.release` == Ring 2 (workspace SDK copied in, strict third-party locks). SDK publish/smoke uses separate jobs.

## Scope
- Services: platform, threads, transformation, workflows, chat, graph, repository, www_ameide, www_ameide_platform.
- Packages: `@ameide/core-proto`, `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts`, shared TS config/telemetry helpers.
- CI/Tilt/Docker flows used by the TS services above.

## Non-goals
- Go/Python migration (covered elsewhere).
- Changing AmeideClient behaviour; this plan only rewires how TS services consume it.

## Plan

### 0) Foundations (workspace-first SDK)
- Single import surface: services import protos/clients from `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts/proto.js` (and SDK entrypoints) in both rings; dist artifacts must not reference `packages/ameide_core_proto`.
- Make the build chain deterministic: `pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto build` → `pnpm --filter @ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts build` using workspace links only; document this as the pre-step for TS service builds.
- Ensure SDK unit/integration tests run against workspace stubs (mock + cluster) and fail fast if the resolved proto package is not the workspace one.

### 1) Guardrails & CI realignment
- Update `.github/workflows/ci-core-quality.yml` to remove “published-only” enforcement for TS and replace with:
  - a check that TS services resolve `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts` from the workspace (no npm.pkg hits) in PR jobs,
  - a lint that forbids `@buf/ameideio_*` imports outside `packages/ameide_core_proto`,
  - a required `pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto build` before typecheck/tests.
- Remove npm.pkg auth from PR/Tilt install paths; keep it only in publish/release workflows.
- Add a policy script that fails if `pnpm why @ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts` shows a non-workspace version in any TS service’s `node_modules`.
- Document Docker split: `.dev` uses `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` + workspace deps and no registry auth; `Dockerfile.release` uses stamped lockfile for third-party deps + `workspace:*` for SDK (copied into the image) with `--frozen-lockfile`.

### 2) Service migrations (single import surface)
For each service: import protos/clients solely from `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts/proto.js` (and SDK entrypoints); ensure Rings 1/2 resolve to the workspace SDK build. Remove registry auth from Docker/Tilt.
- **Platform/Threads/Transformation/Workflows/Chat/Graph/Repository/www_ameide/www_ameide_platform**: update proto barrels/clients to the single import surface; ensure Tilt/dev images run `pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto build` then `pnpm --filter @ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts build` before service builds; confirm bundlers/Jest resolve the workspace SDK path and dist outputs have no `packages/ameide_core_proto` imports.

### 3) Dev ergonomics & Tilt
- Add a single `pnpm proto:ts` (core-proto build) + `pnpm sdk:ts` (SDK build) path to Tilt and devcontainer init so local runs never require registry access.
- Document inner-loop workflow: edit proto → `pnpm proto:ts` → service typecheck/test; Tilt watch should rebuild protos/SDK on proto changes.
- Add a fast “proto drift” check that compares working tree `packages/ameide_core_proto/dist` to regenerated output and fails dev/CI if stale.

### 4) Publish/release path
- Keep `cd-packages` responsible for tagging/publishing `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts`; run `npm pack` + out-of-tree install smoke tests on the built artifact.
- **Prod images (cd-service-images)**: use stamped `pnpm-lock.yaml` for third-party deps + `workspace:*` resolution for SDK; `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` should still resolve to the copied workspace SDK (no npm/pkg access). Dev/Tilt images stay workspace-first.
- Emit SDK version + proto git SHA as artifacts so external consumers can match published SDKs to schema revisions.

### 5) Exit criteria / signals
- Proto changes that remove/rename fields break TS service typecheck/tests locally and in PR CI without hitting npm.pkg.
- `pnpm why @ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts` in each TS service points to the workspace; no `packages/ameide_core_proto` imports in runtime/dist.
- Docker/Tilt/CI paths for TS services run without registry credentials; publish workflow remains green using tagged builds and out-of-tree smoke.
- Service checklist below is all ✅.

## Status (2025-11-24)
- Workspace-first path landed: SDK builds from `packages/ameide_core_proto/dist` (no `@buf/...` in pnpm-lock), and TS services import proto barrels from that package with `workspace:*` SDK deps.
- Service Dockerfiles now build against workspace protos/SDK (`pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto run build` + SDK build) with no registry auth.
- Remaining: add an explicit policy check that services resolve SDK/proto from the workspace and a proto-drift CI gate; re-run SDK + representative service builds in CI to lock this in.
- Verification pending: `pnpm -C packages/ameide_sdk_ts test` and a representative service build (e.g., `pnpm -C services/platform build`).

## 404-go-buf-first-migration.md

---
title: 404 – Go Services Buf-First Migration
status: draft
owners:
  - platform
  - go
created: 2025-11-24
---

## Goal

Move **all Go services (agents, inference_gateway, future templates)** to the 402/407/408 model: proto-first, SDK-only surface with Buf outputs generated into `packages/ameide_sdk_go`, immediate break on proto drift, and outer-loop publishes that do not block internal builds. Services consume stubs from the SDK (not `packages/ameide_core_proto` or `buf.build/gen/...`). Ring 1 and Ring 2 resolve to the workspace SDK (copied/vendor in Dockerfiles); the SDK publish track is separate for external consumers. Versioning/tag authority follows backlog/390 for the publish track.
**Same imports, same source for services**: Go code stays identical across rings; both resolve modules via workspace SDK code, not registry downloads.

## Context

- Current Go services still reference Buf registry stubs (`buf.build/gen/...`) or pull tagged SDKs in go.mod/Dockerfiles. Proto changes do not surface until a publish.
- Buf generation needs to emit stubs (including buf/validate) directly into `packages/ameide_sdk_go` synced from the BSR module; services should import only from that SDK surface.
- Rings 1/2 should both use the workspace SDK (copied/vendor) with no GOPROXY fetch of Ameide modules; the publish track is for external consumers and smoke only.

**Naming:** `Dockerfile.dev` implements Ring 1 (workspace stubs/SDK in Tilt/dev containers). `Dockerfile.release` implements Ring 2 (release/CI builds that pin tagged SDK modules). References below follow that convention.

## Target State (Go)

- `packages/ameide_core_proto` pushes schema to BSR; stubs (including buf/validate) are synced into `packages/ameide_sdk_go/gen/...` from the BSR module; SDK sources are the only import surface for services.
- `packages/ameide_sdk_go` is consumed via `go.work` in Rings 1/2; services do not import `packages/ameide_core_proto/gen/...` or `buf.build/gen/...`.
- Services build/tests run with `GOWORK=auto` and fail immediately when protos change and stubs are regenerated into the SDK.
- Ring 2 service images vendor/copy the workspace SDK and build with `GOWORK=off` pointing to that vendored module; no GOPROXY fetch or GO_SDK_VERSION stamping.
- SDK publish track uses `GOWORK=off` + tagged `ameide-sdk-go@vX.Y.Z` in smoke to guard external consumers.
- Guardrails prevent `buf.build/gen/...` imports, `packages/ameide_core_proto` imports, and Buf GOPROXY usage in service/Dockerfile paths.

## Plan

1) **Stub source pivot (packages/ameide_core_proto → BSR)**
   - Add a Go codegen template (e.g., `buf.gen.go.local.yaml`) that writes stubs into `packages/ameide_sdk_go/gen/go` with module path `github.com/ameideio/ameide-sdk-go/gen/...` (or equivalent) by targeting the BSR module (`buf.build/ameide/core-proto:<label>`).
   - Wire `pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto build` (and CI proto job) to run Go generation against the BSR ref and fail if `git status` shows dirty SDK `gen/go`.
   - Export Go package docs showing the import path pattern for services and SDK (connect + grpc packages) from the SDK module.

2) **SDK alignment (packages/ameide_sdk_go)**
   - Point SDK imports to the in-tree generated stubs under `packages/ameide_sdk_go/gen/...`; trim Buf proxy/env docs.
   - Keep SDK tests green under `GOWORK=auto`; add a quick check that no dependency in go.mod/go.sum references `buf.build`.
   - Document outer-loop publish path: tags build with `GOWORK=off`, `go get github.com/ameideio/ameide-sdk-go@<tag>`, and smoke against a clean module cache (external consumers only; prod images remain workspace SDK-first).

3) **Workspace wiring**
   - Expand `go.work` to include `services/agents` and `services/inference_gateway` so `go list`/`go test ./...` resolve workspace SDK consistently.
   - Add a `tools/go-env.sh` (or README snippet) setting `GOWORK=auto` for dev/CI inner loop; make Tilt/PR jobs invoke Go with `GOWORK=auto`.
   - Add a repo-level lint that rejects `GOPROXY=https://buf.build/...` in Dockerfiles and `buf.build/gen` or `packages/ameide_core_proto` module paths in go.mod/go.sum outside Ring 0 tooling.

4) **Service migrations**
   - **agents**
     - Update imports from `buf.build/gen/...` (or core_proto paths) to `github.com/ameideio/ameide-sdk-go/gen/...`.
     - Drop Buf modules from go.mod; rely on workspace SDK stubs. Ensure integration tests (bufconn) still run under `GOWORK=auto`.
     - Simplify Dockerfile/Dockerfile.dev to remove Buf GOPROXY/GONOSUMDB; dev/Tilt images copy `go.work` + workspace SDK, prod images keep `GOWORK=off` pointed at the copied SDK (no GO_SDK_VERSION/proxy).
   - **inference_gateway**
     - Same import swap to workspace SDK stubs; purge Buf GOPROXY settings.
     - Keep dual-mode integration test using SDK clients; verify spans/metadata assertions still pass with local stubs.
   - **templates/new Go services**
     - Update `services/_templates/integration/go` to use workspace SDK stubs and inherit the new GOPROXY/GOWORK defaults.

5) **CI + release path**
   - **PR/branch**: run `pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto build && go test ./...` from repo root (go.work active); fail on dirty tree or `buf.build`/core_proto imports in services.
   - **Main/tag publish**: run `GOWORK=off go test ./...` in SDK + services using the tagged SDK version for smoke; prod images stay on workspace SDK even after tag.
   - Add an automated check that regenerating protos (`pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto build`) followed by `go test` produces no diff; block merges otherwise.

6) **Clean-up and comms**
   - Update READMEs (core-proto, SDK, services) to reflect “workspace stubs for internal, tagged SDK for external”.
   - Remove Buf registry notes from onboarding docs; keep a short “outer loop publish” appendix that explains when Buf/registry is still used.
   - Announce the migration steps and the temporary dual path (Buf proxy support stays only until both services flip).

## Status (2025-02-22)

- Workspace Go stubs are committed under `packages/ameide_sdk_go/gen/go/...`; `pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto build` emits Go outputs into the SDK.
- Go SDK imports the workspace stubs (no `buf.build` modules).
- `go.work` includes `packages/ameide_sdk_go`, `services/agents`, and `services/inference_gateway`; service Dockerfiles/dev images now set `GOWORK=auto` and build from workspace sources (no Buf GOPROXY).
- Services (`agents`, `inference_gateway`) import stubs from `ameide-sdk-go/gen/...`; integration/test binaries are built from local stubs.
- Remaining gaps: CI guard for `buf.build` imports/stub drift is still needed; root `go.mod` still carries buf.build module deps for tooling and should be folded into the workspace story or isolated. Outer-loop publish smoke with `GOWORK=off` is still required.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [x] `packages/ameide_core_proto` generates and commits Go stubs into the SDK; `pnpm --filter @ameide/core-proto build` is green and leaves a clean tree.
- [x] `packages/ameide_sdk_go` imports only workspace stubs; go.mod/go.sum contain no `buf.build` entries.
- [x] `go.work` includes agents + inference_gateway; `go test ./...` at repo root works without GOPROXY overrides.
- [x] `services/agents` and `services/inference_gateway` import stubs from `ameide-sdk-go/gen/...` and build without Buf registry access.
- [x] Dockerfiles drop Buf GOPROXY and rely on workspace SDK for dev/prod in-repo; tag-smoke runs use `GOWORK=off` + tagged SDK for external consumers.
- [ ] CI enforces no `buf.build` imports in services, validates stub freshness, and runs inner-loop tests with workspace deps; publish jobs smoke `GOWORK=off` with tagged SDK.

## Implementation Status (2025-11-24)

- Ring 0: `packages/ameide_core_proto` generates committed Go stubs into the SDK; `go.mod` clean, `go test` passes.
- Ring 1 SDK: `packages/ameide_sdk_go` imports workspace stubs only; no `buf.build` deps; tests green.
- Services: `agents` and `inference_gateway` import workspace SDK stubs via replaces; `go test` green; Dockerfiles vendor workspace SDK and run with `GOWORK=off`.
- go.work scoped to `sdk_go`, `agents`, `inference_gateway` to avoid container-context path leaks.
- Remaining gap: add CI guards (no `buf.build` imports/GOPROXY/core_proto imports, stub freshness check) and run publish smoke with `GOWORK=off` + tagged SDK.

## 405-docker-files.md

# 405 – Dockerfiles (rings-aligned, SDK-only surface)

This aligns Dockerfiles with 402/407/408: services consume protos only through SDK packages; Buf outputs (including buf/validate) live in the SDK trees. Rings 1 and 2 both use workspace SDKs; the SDK publish/smoke track is separate.

## Rings recap

- **Ring 0 (Buf + core_proto + BSR)** – single schema module; Buf writes stubs into SDK packages by targeting the BSR module.
- **Ring 1 (`Dockerfile.dev`)** – dev/Tilt/PR CI images copy workspace SDK packages (not `packages/ameide_core_proto`), use relaxed installs, no registry access.
- **Ring 2 (`Dockerfile.release`)** – staging/prod images also copy workspace SDK packages (no Ameide registry downloads), use strict frozen installs for third-party deps; Ameide packages resolve via `workspace:*`/vendored SDK. SDK publish/smoke is an outer loop.

## Dev / Tilt Dockerfiles (`Dockerfile.dev`)

General:
- Copy workspace SDK packages only; do not copy `packages/ameide_core_proto`.
- No npm/PyPI/Go registry access for Ameide packages; relaxed installs for third-party deps.
- Service-image workflow on `dev` selects `Dockerfile.dev`; keep SDK-only rules identical to Ring 2.

TypeScript:
- Copy `packages/ameide_sdk_ts` + service sources; install with `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`.
- Imports must go through `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts/proto.js`; dist must not reference `packages/ameide_core_proto`.

Go:
- Copy `packages/ameide_sdk_go`; set `GOPROXY=off`; use a shared helper (e.g., `scripts/ci/go_use_workspace_sdk.sh`) to prime the SDK module, apply `go mod edit -replace` to the workspace SDK, and `go mod download` before build/test.
- Services import `ameide-sdk-go/gen/...` only; no `buf.build/gen/...` modules.

Python:
- Copy `packages/ameide_sdk_python`; use `tool.uv.sources` + editable installs; `uv sync` (non-frozen) ok.
- Imports must use `ameide_core_proto.*` from the SDK package; no workspace `ameide_core_proto` alias.

## CI / Prod Dockerfiles (`Dockerfile.release`)

General:
- Copy workspace SDK packages; do not copy `packages/ameide_core_proto`.
- Ameide packages must resolve from the copied SDKs (no registry fetch). Frozen installs apply to third-party deps.

TypeScript:
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` stamped for third-party deps; `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts` stays `workspace:*`.
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` should resolve to the copied workspace SDK; fail builds that pull from npm.

Go:
- Vendor/copy `packages/ameide_sdk_go`; set `GOPROXY=off`; use the shared helper to prime the SDK module, apply the replace to the vendored path, and `go mod download`/`go mod tidy` with tags as needed.
- `go.mod` should use the SDK module path with a replace to the vendored path; no `buf.build/gen/...` modules in service images; no `GO_SDK_VERSION` stamping.

Python:
- Copy `packages/ameide_sdk_python`; `uv sync --frozen` with `tool.uv.sources` so Ameide packages resolve to workspace; forbid PyPI for Ameide deps.
- Forbid direct BSR stub package installs in service images across languages (`@buf/...`, `buf.build/gen/go/...`, BSR Python wheels); only SDK packages should appear.

## Guardrails

- `scripts/policy/check_docker_sources.sh` expects SDK copies and fails on registry fetches, `packages/ameide_core_proto` copies, or GO_SDK_VERSION/PYTHON_SDK_VERSION/NPM-SDK version stamping in service Dockerfiles.
- `scripts/policy/check_dockerfile_parity.sh` enforces consistency between `Dockerfile.dev` and `Dockerfile.release`:
  - Neither should copy `packages/ameide_core_proto` (SDK-only surface)
  - Python services must have consistent `PYTHONPATH` including SDK src in both variants
  - TypeScript services must copy `packages/ameide_sdk_ts` in both variants
  - Go services must copy `packages/ameide_sdk_go` and use `go_use_workspace_sdk.sh` in both variants
  - No SDK version stamping in either variant
- `scripts/policy/enforce_proto_imports.sh` and `scripts/policy/check_lock_hygiene.sh` enforce SDK-only imports (no `packages/ameide_core_proto` in runtime code) and buf/validate presence in SDK trees.
- `scripts/ci/go_use_workspace_sdk.sh` provides a shared Go workspace-SDK hydration step (prime SDK module, disable GOPROXY, apply replace); dev and release Dockerfiles should use it for Go services.
- CI should fail if `pnpm why @ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts`, Go `go.mod` resolution, or Python imports resolve anywhere other than the workspace SDK packages for Rings 1/2.

# Reality check (Jan 2025)

> ⚠️ **Remote-first note:** References to “cluster mode” in this document still assume a local k3d environment. The default now is to run integration/e2e packs against the shared AKS dev namespace via Telepresence (see [435-remote-first-development.md](435-remote-first-development.md)). Update any k3d instructions before using them.

**What exists**

* Colocation: Most services/packages have `__tests__/unit` and `__tests__/integration`; some e2e exist (Playwright specs in `services/www_ameide_platform/.../__tests__/e2e`, minimal Python/Go e2e). Layout is uneven: many TS tests live deep under feature folders; agents runtime now lives at `services/agents_runtime` per the folder-underscore policy.
* Orchestration: `pnpm test:integration`/`pnpm test:e2e` drive `tools/integration-runner`, which discovers packs conventionally and renders Helm jobs (shared chart). Tilt has manual `integration-*` resources and builds images for packs; Playwright is a dedicated pack (`tests/playwright-runner`).
* Dual mode: Helpers enforce `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE` (mock|cluster). Some suites only run in cluster (`services/agents_runtime/__tests__/integration` exits in mock). Mock-vs-live coverage is uneven across services.
* Artifacts: Integration/e2e artifacts land in `artifacts/integration/<service>/<timestamp>` or `artifacts/e2e/...`; runner can emit `summary.txt` and upload to S3. Unit/Jest CI output goes to `.test-results` and `.coverage`. No repo-wide JSON summary or single path scheme.
* CI: `ci-core-quality` runs platform Jest unit+integration and SDK tests with JUnit; `ci-go-integration` runs Go integration (mock; cluster only via manual dispatch); `ci-integration-packs` runs integration-runner (staging values). No single unit→integration→e2e pipeline for all services.
* Values/infra: Local integration values exist for many services; staging/prod overlays exist for a subset (e.g., no staging/prod graph/threads). Some runner `--list` entries show missing values (graph, ameide_core_proto).

**Gaps vs target**

* No repo-level `make/just test-{unit,integration,e2e}`; commands are per-service and CI-specific.
* Folder taxonomy not consistent (`__tests__/{unit,integration,e2e}` scattered, many nested feature paths; duplicate service names).
* Mock/live parity missing; some packs cannot run in mock and some lack non-local values files.
* Artifact formats not standardized to `artifacts/test-results/<service>/<suite>.xml` + JSON.
* No single README/contract for env vars (`TEST_ENV`/`TEST_PROFILE` vs `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE`), Tilt buttons, or how to run by service.

**Sequenced plan (what to build next)**

1. **Repo-level entrypoints + artifacts (do first)**

   * Add a root `Makefile`/`justfile` with `test-unit`, `test-integration`, and `test-e2e` targets. Each accepts `SERVICE=<name>` (defaults to `all`) plus `TEST_ENV`/`TEST_PROFILE` (`mock|cluster`) and shells out to `scripts/test-unit.sh`, etc.
   * `scripts/test-unit.sh` dispatches by language:
     * TS: `pnpm --filter "<svc>" jest … --json --outputFile artifacts/test-results/<svc>/unit.results.json --reporters=default --reporters=jest-junit` (Jest already matches `__tests__` patterns; CLI docs confirm `--json/--outputFile` + reporters). 
     * Python: `pytest services/<svc>/__tests__/unit --junitxml=artifacts/test-results/<svc>/unit.junit.xml` (pytest’s `--junitxml` flag is stable).
     * Go: run through `gotestsum --junitfile artifacts/test-results/<svc>/unit.junit.xml ./services/<svc>/...` (or `go test -json | go-junit-report`).
     * Playwright: add the builtin `junit` reporter in `playwright.config.ts` targeting `artifacts/test-results/<svc>/e2e.junit.xml`.
   * `scripts/test-integration.sh` / `scripts/test-e2e.sh` wrap `tools/integration-runner` so every pack inherits the env/profile flags and writes artifacts under `artifacts/test-results/<pack>/integration-<profile>.junit.xml`. Extend integration-runner with a `--junit-root` flag that mounts `/artifacts/test-results`.
   * Canonical artifact shape:

     ```
     artifacts/
       test-results/
         <service-or-pack>/
           unit.junit.xml
           unit.results.json
           integration-mock.junit.xml
           integration-cluster.junit.xml
           e2e-mock.junit.xml
           e2e-cluster.junit.xml
     ```

     JUnit XML is the contract for CI/uploaders (pytest, jest-junit, gotestsum, Playwright all emit it); JSON is optional for internal analytics. Keep the integration-runner `summary.txt`, but link it from this tree.

2. **Env contract + dual-mode cleanup**

   * Define `TEST_ENV` (`local|ci|dev|staging|prod|cluster`) and `TEST_PROFILE` (`mock|cluster`). Always export `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE=$TEST_PROFILE` for backwards compatibility until all packs switch over.
   * Add tiny helpers per language (TS, Py, Go) to read the env/profile once and derive endpoints/mocks. Example: `getTestConfig()` returning `{ env, profile }` for TS; `pytest` fixture that exposes the same; Go package for shared integration helpers.
   * Update `run_integration_tests.sh` scripts to source the helper, enforce required env vars per profile, and pass `TEST_ENV`/`TEST_PROFILE` through to Jest/pytest/go test.
   * Make every integration/e2e pack runnable in **both** profiles. For suites that currently exit early in mock mode, add mock fixtures (e.g., Playwright `page.route()` intercepts, Python stub servers, Go in-memory Connect stubs) so “mock” means “run against Tilt/k3d with fake upstreams” instead of “skip outright”.

3. **Layout + naming normalization**

   * Move scattered TS tests into each service’s `__tests__/{unit,integration,e2e}` (Jest already treats files in `__tests__` as tests; only need to move folders). Keep shared helpers in `tests/shared` or language-specific libs.
   * For Python, keep `test_*.py` but enforce `pytest.ini` `testpaths = services packages` so discovery respects the new layout.
   * For Go, leave `_test.go` next to code or collect them under `__tests__` per package if you want symmetry, but use `go test ./...`/`gotestsum` consistently.
   * Naming duplication resolved: agents runtime is at `services/agents_runtime` (underscored folders, hyphenated filenames where applicable); keep updating any straggler references in pnpm workspaces, Go modules, Dockerfiles, Helm values, and integration-runner metadata as they surface.

4. **Tilt buttons, Helm values, and Argo hooks**

   * Fill Helm value gaps so every pack has `infra/kubernetes/environments/{local,staging,production}/integration-tests/<pack>.yaml`. This lets `integration-runner --list` succeed everywhere and gives Tilt/k3d/CI the same manifests.
   * In Tiltfile, add `local_resource` entries such as `test-agents-unit` and `test-agents-int-mock` that simply call the root `just test-*` commands with `TEST_ENV=local` and `TEST_PROFILE=mock|cluster`. Use `auto_init=False` so they only run when a dev clicks the button; share the same deps as the services they exercise.
   * For staging/prod, add optional ArgoCD `PostSync` hooks that run the same test job Helm chart (with `TEST_ENV=staging`, `TEST_PROFILE=cluster`) to gate deployments on live smoke tests. Reuse the shared test-job chart so Tilt, CI, and Argo all execute identical jobs.

Document the above in `tests/README.md` (commands, env vars, artifact paths) and cross-link from service READMEs so the workflow is visible.

## 407-single-proto-surface-sdk.md

# 407 – Single proto surface via SDK (objective + gaps)

## Objective
Consume protos only through SDK packages (Go/Python/TS) with Buf/BSR emitting stubs directly into the SDK trees. Services/images must not rely on `packages/ameide_core_proto` copies; dist artifacts import SDK barrels; policies/CI enforce SDK-only (including buf/validate).

## Current alignment (2025-11-27)
- Buf templates include protovalidate for Go/Python/TS; SDK sync scripts run in CI (`ci-proto.yml` sdk-sync-bsr) and Tilt.
- Policy scripts enforced in PR gate and service-image workflow:
  - `scripts/policy/enforce_proto_generation.sh` (single Buf module guard)
  - `scripts/policy/enforce_proto_imports.sh` (blocks @buf/*, packages/ameide_core_proto in source/dist, BSR stub wheels/modules)
  - `scripts/policy/check_proto_workspace_barrels.sh` (TS barrels import SDK proto)
  - `scripts/policy/check_lock_hygiene.sh` + `scripts/policy/check_go_option_a.sh`
  - `scripts/policy/check_docker_sources.sh` (Dockerfiles copy SDKs, no core_proto/registry SDK fetches)
- `cd-service-images` now picks `Dockerfile.dev` on dev branch and `Dockerfile.release` on main/tags, keeping Ring 1/2 workspace-first.

## Remaining gaps
1) **Buf/validate regeneration tracking**
   - Ensure a periodic or on-change regeneration of SDK stubs when Buf templates change; add a note to bump proto runbook to re-run SDK sync after template changes.

2) **Doc parity**
   - Cross-check 402/403/404/405/408 to ensure they no longer suggest pulling published SDKs for service images or copying core_proto; align wording with workspace SDK-only for Rings 1/2.

3) **Artifact scans**
   - Keep TS dist scans for `@buf/` and `packages/ameide_core_proto` (already in policy); consider similar checks for Go/Py built artifacts referencing BSR/gen paths.

4) **Channel clarity**
   - Service-image workflow now respects branch channel for Dockerfile selection; ensure docs mention dev → Dockerfile.dev and main/tags → Dockerfile.release.

## 408-workspace-first-ring-2.md

---
title: 406 - Rings refactor: workspace-first Ring 2
status: draft
owners:
  - platform
created: 2025-11-27
---

## Intent

- Keep 407's objective: single proto surface via SDK (TS/Go/Python), no services or images import workspace `ameide_core_proto` or dist bundles directly.
- Buf emits all stubs (including buf/validate) directly into the SDK trees.
- Ring 1 and Ring 2 stay workspace-first by using SDK code from the repo (not registries); Ring 2 adds stricter locking for third-party deps. Service-image workflow now selects Dockerfile.dev on dev branch and Dockerfile.release on main/tags.
- Published SDKs are only for external consumers and out-of-tree smoke/validation jobs.

---

## 1. Updated ring definitions

**Ring 0 - Schema (unchanged)**

- `packages/ameide_core_proto` remains the single schema module.
- Buf runs here and writes TS/Go/Python stubs (including buf/validate) directly into the SDK packages. Consumers import via SDK barrels; no runtime path should point at `packages/ameide_core_proto`.

**Ring 1 - Inner loop (dev / PR CI / Tilt)**

- Who: dev/Tilt containers (`Dockerfile.dev`), PR CI jobs, local dev.
- Inputs:
  - Workspace SDK packages (`packages/ameide_sdk_ts`, `packages/ameide_sdk_go`, `packages/ameide_sdk_python`) that already contain Buf outputs.
  - Looser dependency strictness (TS `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`; Go `GOWORK=auto`; Python `uv sync` + editable via `tool.uv.sources`).
- No registry access required, and no runtime/Dockerfile references to `packages/ameide_core_proto`.

**Ring 2 - Workspace-first release images**

- Who: all staging/prod service images (`Dockerfile.release`) and prod-like internal images.
- Inputs:
  - Workspace SDK packages with generated stubs (no direct `ameide_core_proto` copies).
  - Stricter dependency treatment for non-Ameide deps:
    - TS: frozen `pnpm-lock.yaml` for third-party deps; Ameide packages stay `workspace:*`.
    - Go: vendored or copied workspace SDK module; `GOWORK=off` ok as long as SDK code is from the repo, not the proxy.
    - Python: `uv.lock` + `tool.uv.sources`; `uv sync --frozen` for third-party deps.
- No Ameide packages are installed from registries in Ring 2 service images; Dockerfiles copy SDK packages only (not `packages/ameide_core_proto`).

**SDK publish & smoke path (outer loop)**

- `cd-packages` builds/publishes SDK artifacts and runs out-of-tree smoke tests that install them from registries. This path is separate from Ring 2 service images.

---

## 2. Current inconsistencies this fixes

### 2.1 TypeScript

- 403/405 describe Ring 2 as installing published SDKs and allow dist imports from `packages/ameide_core_proto/dist`, conflicting with the SDK-only surface.
- Buf templates omit buf/validate output into the SDK, so the SDK surface is incomplete.
- Service-image workflow now uses `Dockerfile.dev` for dev branch; ensure dev Dockerfiles still copy SDKs and not core_proto.

### 2.2 Go

- 405 still stamps `GO_SDK_VERSION` and fetches SDK/core_proto from the proxy for Ring 2 instead of using workspace SDK sources.
- `go.work` and docs point services at `packages/ameide_core_proto` paths, not SDK-generated stubs.

### 2.3 Python

- 403-Python is close, but CI prep aliases `ameide_core_proto` into `ameide_sdk.generated`, and 405 still calls for PyPI wheels in Ring 2.

This refactor aligns all languages with 407: services only see proto through SDKs; Ring 2 uses workspace SDK code (not registries); publishes are isolated to the SDK product track.

---

## 3. Ring-aligned behaviour per language

### 3.1 TypeScript

**Ring 1 (`Dockerfile.dev`) - SDK-only surface**

- Services import types/clients from workspace `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts` barrels; dist artifacts must not reference `packages/ameide_core_proto/dist`.
- Buf/validate outputs are generated into `packages/ameide_sdk_ts` and checked in for dev/CI use.

**Ring 2 (`Dockerfile.release`) - workspace SDK, no core_proto copies**

- `pnpm-lock.yaml` is frozen for third-party deps and resolves `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts` via `workspace:*`; there should be no `@ameide/core-proto` dependency in service code.
- Dockerfile copies `packages/ameide_sdk_ts` (with generated stubs) into the context; it must not copy `packages/ameide_core_proto`.
- Policies fail Ring 2 if `pnpm why @ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts` resolves to npm instead of workspace, or if any Dockerfile/import references `packages/ameide_core_proto`.

**SDK publish track (TS)**

- `cd-packages` builds `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts` from the checked-in SDK tree, publishes to npm.pkg, and runs out-of-tree smoke tests installing the tagged package in a clean project.

### 3.2 Go

**Ring 1 (`Dockerfile.dev`)**

- `go.work` + `GOWORK=auto` point services at the workspace SDK module (Buf-generated stubs in `packages/ameide_sdk_go`), not `packages/ameide_core_proto`.

**Ring 2 (`Dockerfile.release`) - workspace SDK, no core_proto copies**

- Service images do not fetch `github.com/ameideio/ameide-sdk-go` or core_proto from the proxy.
- Dockerfile vendors or copies `packages/ameide_sdk_go` (with generated stubs) into the build; `GOWORK=off` points at that vendored SDK module.
- `GO_SDK_VERSION` stamping is only for SDK smoke jobs, not for service `go.mod` in Ring 2.

**SDK publish track (Go)**

- `cd-packages` tags/publishes `github.com/ameideio/ameide-sdk-go@vX.Y.Z` and runs smoke jobs that set `GOWORK=off`, `go get` the tagged SDK, and run targeted SDK tests.

### 3.3 Python

**Ring 1 (`Dockerfile.dev`)**

- `uv sync` with workspace `ameide-sdk-python` via `tool.uv.sources`; no PyPI required. Remove any `ameide_core_proto` alias so imports are `ameide_core_proto.*` (from the SDK package) only.

**Ring 2 (`Dockerfile.release`) - workspace SDK, no core_proto copies**

- `Dockerfile.release` copies `packages/ameide_sdk_python` (with generated stubs) into the image.
- Uses `uv.lock` + `tool.uv.sources`; `uv sync --frozen` pins third-party deps only. Fails if `ameide-sdk-python` resolves from PyPI or if `packages/ameide_core_proto` is copied.

**SDK publish track (Python)**

- `cd-packages` builds the wheel from `packages/ameide_sdk_python`, publishes to PyPI, and runs out-of-tree smoke installs in clean venvs.

---

## 4. Changes to existing docs

- **402**: Fast map should show Ring 1/2 built from workspace SDKs (no core_proto imports) and a separate SDK product track.
- **403 - TS**:
  - Goal: prod images also use workspace `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts`; no `@ameide/core-proto` references in code or dist.
  - Publish/release path: stamped lockfile for third-party deps + `workspace:*` for SDK; add SDK publish + smoke subsection.
- **403 - Python**:
  - Make `Dockerfile.release` the Ring 2 Dockerfile; services import `ameide_core_proto.*` from the SDK package; no workspace core_proto alias; no PyPI wheel in Ring 2.
- **404 - Go**:
  - Remove proxy/`GO_SDK_VERSION` guidance for service images; services import SDK-generated stubs; stamping only for SDK smoke tests.
- **405 - Dockerfiles**:
  - Impact: Ring 2 images copy workspace SDK packages (with stubs), not `packages/ameide_core_proto`, and must not install Ameide packages from registries.
  - Per-language prod/CI sections: drop version stamping/fetching; require SDK copies only.
  - `scripts/policy/check_docker_sources.sh`: expect workspace SDK copies, fail on registry installs or core_proto references.

---

## 5. Guardrails and acceptance

**Guardrails**

- TS: CI fails if `pnpm why @ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts` in Ring 2 resolves off workspace or if imports/Dockerfiles reference `packages/ameide_core_proto`.
- Go: CI lints that Ring 2 Dockerfiles omit GOPROXY/`GO_SDK_VERSION`, `go.mod` has no tagged SDK requirements, and no code imports `packages/ameide_core_proto`.
- Python: CI checks Ring 2 resolves `ameide-sdk-python` via `tool.uv.sources` and imports are `ameide_core_proto.*` from the SDK package.
- Buf/validate: CI confirms buf/validate outputs exist inside each SDK package tree for TS/Go/Python.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Proto change -> SDK regeneration (via Buf) -> services in Ring 1 and Ring 2 fail until SDK trees are refreshed, without any SDK publish or registry access.
- No Ring 2 Dockerfile fetches Ameide SDK or core_proto from npm/PyPI/Go proxy; all copy `packages/ameide_sdk_*` only and exclude `packages/ameide_core_proto`.
- SDK publish pipelines (TS/Go/Py) run out-of-tree smoke tests that install published SDKs from registries and pass.
- 402/403/404/405 reflect the SDK-only proto surface and workspace-first Ring 2, with no guidance to use published SDKs or core_proto copies in service builds.

## 409-ameide-cli.md

# 409 – Ameide CLI (BSR SDK consumption)

## Goals
- Ship a single CLI (one language) that consumes the BSR-generated SDK for protos.
- Keep AmeideClient (and helpers) in the language SDK package; services and the CLI import it rather than copying client code.
- No local proto generation: proto stubs come from the BSR SDK; lockfiles pin exact versions.
- End users shouldn’t need Buf installed or `.proto` files; only the CLI and its pinned deps.

## Decisions
- Language: choose one (Go binary for easiest distro; or Node/Python if ecosystem fit matters). Avoid multiple CLIs.
- Proto source: BSR SDK only; no workspace `packages/ameide_core_proto` generation in the CLI workflow.
- Client surface: lives in the Ameide SDK package; CLI depends on that package + the BSR SDK.
- Auth/registry: either bundle the SDK in the release artifact (Go vendoring / npm pack / wheel) or ensure the CLI has access to the BSR registry at install time.

## Work items
- Pick language/runtime and distribution target (Go binary vs npm package vs pip package).
- Wire CLI deps to the BSR SDK + AmeideClient package; remove any buf/protoc steps from CLI build scripts.
- Add lock/pin enforcement so CLI builds fail if SDK versions drift (e.g., go.sum/module pin; package-lock/pnpm-lock; uv.lock).
- Add install docs for registry auth (or bundle the SDK so no auth is needed at runtime).
- Add smoke tests: install CLI from its release artifact, run a trivial command that exercises the AmeideClient against a mock/fixture.
- Update policies/docs to note the CLI is a consumer of the SDK-only proto surface; no workspace proto imports.

## 410-bsr-native.md

# 410 – BSR-native SDKs

## Objective
Option A (workspace-first SDKs): BSR is the source of truth for the proto module; SDKs sync stubs from BSR and keep them committed; services in all rings consume only the workspace SDK copies (never direct BSR packages), and published SDKs/BSR packages are for external consumers and smokes only.

## Principles
- **SDK definition:** SDK = Ameide’s language package per runtime (ameide-sdk-go, @ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts, ameide-sdk-python) that bundles synced stubs + helpers (AmeideClient, auth, telemetry, retries). Services import only these SDKs.
- **Single proto surface:** BSR owns schema + stubs; SDKs expose the surface. Services never import workspace `packages/ameide_core_proto` or direct BSR stub packages.
- **Workspace-only for Rings:** services/Docker builds copy workspace SDKs; no registry fetches in Rings 1/2/3.
- **Publish for third parties only:** published SDKs/BSR packages are for external consumers + external smokes, not for internal service builds.
- **Policy enforcement:** CI fails on any workspace proto imports or direct BSR stub imports in services; only SDK imports allowed.
- **Consumption split:** SDKs sync and bundle stubs from the BSR module; services depend only on SDKs (workspace copies in internal rings), never on BSR stub packages directly.

## Plan (phases)

### Phase 0 – Prep
- Confirm BSR module and labels (e.g., `buf.build/ameide/core-proto` with `main/dev/etc.`).
- Add `proto-source.json` to each SDK repo noting the BSR module/ref it syncs from.
- Keep SDK naming stable (Go: `github.com/ameideio/ameide-sdk-go`; TS: `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts`; Py: `ameide-sdk-python` with `ameide_core_proto.*` imports).
**Status:** proto-source.json added for Go/TS/Py (module `buf.build/ameideio/ameide:main`). Strategy: SDKs sync and bundle stubs from BSR; services consume SDKs only.
**Done:** proto-source.json added (Go/TS/Py); BSR endpoints identified for TS/Go/Py; strategy locked to “sync + bundle stubs in SDKs; services never import BSR stubs.”
**Gaps:** ensure all SDKs consistently sync from BSR with a no-diff check; keep stubs committed in the SDKs.

### Phase 1 – SDKs sync from BSR (no service generation)
- Add per-SDK sync scripts that run `buf generate buf.build/ameide/core-proto:<ref> --template <sdk-template> --output <sdk-gen-root>`.
  - Go: `scripts/sync_from_bsr_go.sh` → `gen/`.
  - TS: `scripts/sync_from_bsr_ts.sh` → `src/gen/`.
  - Py: `scripts/sync_from_bsr_py.sh` → `src/ameide_core_proto/`.
- Remove/archive service/Tilt proto-gen steps; generation lives only in SDK sync jobs.
- Add “no-diff after sync” CI per SDK: run sync, `git diff --exit-code`.
- Optionally validate the synced BSR ref matches `proto-source.json`.
**Status:** sync scripts + `buf.gen.bsr-*` templates added for Go/TS/Py; CI job `sdk-sync-bsr` added to `ci-proto` to run sync + diff; Tilt runs sync before SDK tests. TS/Go/Py sync scripts run clean; TS/Go/Py tests pass on bundled stubs.
**Done:** added BSR sync templates and scripts (Go/TS/Py); added proto-source.json; CI `sdk-sync-bsr` runs sync+diff; Tilt SDK resources run sync before tests; TS stubs regenerated locally and direct BSR dep removed; Go/Py sync + test passed.
**Gaps:** ensure sync scripts are the only path; clean up any lingering generation references; keep “sync from BSR + no-diff” as the steady state (not migrating to direct BSR packages).

### Phase 2 – Services consume SDKs only
- Imports:
  - Go: `github.com/ameideio/ameide-sdk-go/...`
  - TS: `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts/...` (or barrels)
  - Py: `ameide_sdk.*` / `ameide_core_proto.*` exposed by the SDK package (never from `packages/ameide_core_proto`).
- Internal rings resolve SDKs from workspace copies:
  - Go: `go.work` + `replace` to `packages/ameide_sdk_go`.
  - TS: workspace/paths to `packages/ameide_sdk_ts`.
  - Py: `tool.uv.sources`/path to `packages/ameide_sdk_python`.
- No registry installs in internal rings; published SDKs only for external smokes.
- Update Dockerfiles to copy SDKs (not `packages/ameide_core_proto`) and avoid registry fetches in internal rings.
**Status:** imports aligned; workspace resolution in place. TS proto gen references removed from Tilt; dev Dockerfiles now copy SDKs only (no core_proto builds). All SDKs bundle synced stubs; no direct BSR deps in services.
**Done:** services/imports mostly on SDK-only; workspace resolution via go.work/tsconfig/uv sources; Tilt SDK resources sync stubs and test; removed @ameide/core-proto builds from dev Dockerfiles.
**Gaps:** keep Dockerfile/dist scans enforced so services never import/copy workspace proto or BSR stubs; continue tightening Go/Py checks; keep SDK bundling in place; ensure Tilt/CI never pull BSR packages directly into services.

### Phase 3 – Policy enforcement
- Block imports in services that reference `packages/ameide_core_proto` or direct BSR stub packages (Go/TS/Py).
- Block service Dockerfiles that copy `packages/ameide_core_proto` or install SDKs from registries in internal rings.
- Add TS dist scans to fail on workspace proto paths; similar guards for Go/Py sources.
- Keep “no-diff after sync” checks in SDK repos.
**Status:** core policy script updated to new Python import rules; TS policy now blocks `@buf/...` in services; Docker policy blocks @buf/buf.build/gen/go/Python BSR wheels in images; generation guardrails enforce a single Buf module without rebuilding core_proto dist. Bundled stubs remain.
**Done:** Python import policy updated to prefer `ameide_core_proto.*` from SDK; SDK sync CI added; TS policy blocks `@buf/...` in services; Docker policy blocks BSR stub installs; TS dist scan blocks @buf/... in build outputs; generation policy now focuses on Buf module placement only.
**Gaps:** add scans to block `buf.build/gen/...` imports in services (Go/Py); add TS/Go/Py dist scans for BSR/core_proto paths where missing; keep policies aligned with bundled-stub SDKs.

### Phase 4 – Clean up and docs
- Delete/archive proto-generation scripts from services/Tilt; keep `packages/ameide_core_proto` schema-only.
- Document “how to bump proto”: bump BSR label → run SDK sync scripts → PR SDKs → update services if needed.
- Document “when to use AmeideClient vs raw stubs” per language (default: AmeideClient).
- Cross-link 407 (single proto surface) and this doc.
**Status:** docs refreshed toward SDK-only consumption; generation scripts/Tilt cleanup pending. BSR dependency endpoints recorded (see Phase 0). TS local stubs restored; Go/Py still bundle stubs. Need a “bump proto” runbook and AmeideClient vs raw stubs guidance per language.
**Done:** core docs (402/403/404/405/407) aligned to mention BSR-sync; TS gen references removed from Tilt; endpoints recorded; service/SDK docs updated to reflect SDK-only surfaces and committed BSR-synced stubs.
**Gaps:** remove any remaining service/Tilt generation paths; finalize bump-proto runbook inline with BSR sync; add AmeideClient vs raw stub guidance per language; finalize policy/docs with bundled-stub model.

### Bump proto runbook (SDK sync model)
1. Update `packages/ameide_core_proto` schema and push to BSR (`buf build && buf push`).
2. In each SDK:
   - Update `proto-source.json` if the label/ref changes.
   - Run `scripts/sync_from_bsr.sh <label>` (Go/TS/Py).
   - Verify `git diff --exit-code` after sync and commit regenerated stubs.
3. Run SDK tests (Tilt/CI) to ensure workspace SDKs are fresh.
4. Update services if imports changed; keep services pointed at workspace SDKs.

### AmeideClient vs raw stubs
- Default: services consume AmeideClient (or SDK helpers) from the SDK package.
- Raw stubs should be used only inside the SDK or advanced cases; forbid direct use of BSR stub packages in services.

## CI policy scripts (Option A guardrails)
- Entry: `scripts/policy/run_all.sh` (workspace channel by default; set `SDK_POLICY_CHANNEL=release` only for publish strictness)
- `scripts/policy/enforce_proto_generation.sh`: enforce single Buf module (buf.gen* only under packages/ameide_core_proto).
- `scripts/policy/enforce_proto_imports.sh`: block service imports of workspace proto/BSR stubs; enforce SDK-only surface; includes dist/Docker scans.
- `scripts/policy/check_proto_workspace_barrels.sh`: ensure proto barrels point at SDK surfaces.
- `scripts/policy/check_proto_source.sh`: validate proto-source.json alignment with the BSR module/ref.
- `scripts/policy/check_lock_hygiene.sh`: verify SDK lockfile/import hygiene (TS/Go/Py).
- `scripts/policy/check_go_option_a.sh`: guard Go services to use workspace SDK stubs (Option A).
- `scripts/policy/check_go_replaces.sh`: ensure Go replaces point at the workspace SDK copy.
- `scripts/policy/check_docker_sources.sh`: block Dockerfiles from copying packages/ameide_core_proto or fetching Ameide SDKs from registries in Rings 1/2.
- `scripts/policy/ts/rewrite_lock.sh` / `scripts/policy/ts/rewrite_manifests.py`: rewrite TS manifests/lock to enforce workspace SDK resolution for Rings 1/2.
- `scripts/ci/lint_helm_charts.sh`: Helm lint guardrail (used in ci-helm workflow).
- Other CI helpers invoked by GitHub workflows (publish/pack/smoke/sign/setup): `scripts/ci/compute_sdk_versions.sh`, `define_download_helper.sh`, `generate_bsr_artifacts.sh`, `generate_*_sbom.sh` (TS/Go/Python/config), `install_node_workspace_deps.sh`, `install_python_workspace_sdks.sh`, `install_ripgrep.sh`, `install_syft_cosign.sh`, `install_oras.sh`, `login_ghcr.sh`, `pack_*` (TS/Go/Python/config), `prepare_python_env.sh`, `publish_python*.sh`, `publish_ts.sh`, `push_to_ghcr.sh`, `recreate_version_artifacts.sh`, `setup_buf_go_proxy.sh`, `setup_go_auth.sh`, `setup_npmrc.sh`, `sign_oci_artifacts.sh`, `smoke_*` (ghcr, pnpm, ts_registries), `sync_go_repo.sh`, `update_dev_tags.sh`, `verify_*` (ghcr_aliases, go_get, npm_publication, proto_bundle, ts_tgz).

## Open questions
- Exact sync mechanism per language (buf remote generate vs fetch + generate) and cadence.
- Version alignment: how to record “SDK is synced to BSR ref X” (e.g., `proto-source.json`).
- Authoring flow: always push from `packages/ameide_core_proto` to BSR, then sync back? Or evolve `packages/ameide_core_proto` into a pure schema mirror.***

title: 411 - Policy & Guardrails Inventory
status: draft

## Scope
Inventory of CI/guardrail scripts, what they enforce, and where they run (Tilt/CI/CD). Aligns with Option A (workspace-first SDKs with BSR sync + committed stubs).

## Policy scripts (Option A guardrails)
- Entry: `scripts/policy/run_all.sh` (default `SDK_POLICY_CHANNEL=workspace`; set `release` only for publish-time strictness if needed).
- `scripts/policy/enforce_proto_generation.sh` — enforce single Buf module (buf.gen* only under packages/ameide_core_proto).
- `scripts/policy/enforce_proto_imports.sh` — block service imports of workspace proto/BSR stubs; enforce SDK-only surface; scans dist/Docker for frozen-lock installs.
- `scripts/policy/check_proto_workspace_barrels.sh` — ensure proto barrels point at SDK surfaces.
- `scripts/policy/check_proto_source.sh` — validate proto-source.json alignment with the BSR module/ref.
- `scripts/policy/check_lock_hygiene.sh` — verify SDK lockfile/import hygiene (TS/Go/Py).
- `scripts/policy/check_go_option_a.sh` — guard Go services to use workspace SDK stubs (Option A).
- `scripts/policy/check_go_replaces.sh` — ensure Go replaces point at workspace SDK copies (workspace); in release channel, expect stamping instead.
- `scripts/policy/check_docker_sources.sh` — block Dockerfiles from copying packages/ameide_core_proto or fetching Ameide SDKs from registries in Rings 1/2.
- `scripts/policy/ts/rewrite_lock.sh` / `scripts/policy/ts/rewrite_manifests.py` — rewrite TS manifests/lock to enforce workspace SDK resolution for Rings 1/2.

## CI helper scripts (invoked by GitHub workflows)
- Helm lint: scripts/ci/lint_helm_charts.sh (ci-helm).
- Buf/BSR proto flow: scripts/ci/compute_sdk_versions.sh, define_download_helper.sh, generate_bsr_artifacts.sh, generate_*_sbom.sh (TS/Go/Python/config), setup_buf_go_proxy.sh.
- Workspace SDK installs/auth: scripts/ci/install_node_workspace_deps.sh, install_python_workspace_sdks.sh, install_ripgrep.sh, install_syft_cosign.sh, install_oras.sh, login_ghcr.sh, setup_go_auth.sh, setup_npmrc.sh.
- Packaging/publish/smoke/sign: scripts/ci/pack_* (TS/Go/Python/config), publish_* (python/ts), push_to_ghcr.sh, sign_oci_artifacts.sh, smoke_* (ghcr, pnpm, ts_registries), recreate_version_artifacts.sh, update_dev_tags.sh.
- Verification: scripts/ci/verify_* (ghcr_aliases, go_get, npm_publication, proto_bundle, ts_tgz).
  - Tagging/aliases: compute_sdk_versions.sh emits channel-aware tags; cd-service-images derives dev → dev+SHA, main → latest+SHA, tags → SemVer/major-minor/latest+SHA; push_to_ghcr.sh + verify_ghcr_aliases.sh apply the same tag matrix for SDK artifacts (cd-packages) and service images.

## Workflow coverage (high level)
- ci-proto.yml: buf format/lint/breaking; generate/push BSR; sdk-sync-bsr (no-diff after sync for Go/TS/Py); sdk-smoke.
- cd-service-images.yml: runs policy scripts (install_ripgrep → proto/import/barrel/lock/Docker source checks); builds service images from workspace SDKs.
- cd-packages*.yml: setup/auth, policy scripts via install_ripgrep, pack/publish SDKs for external consumers.
  - Tagging: dev → dev+SHA, main → latest+SHA, tags → SemVer/major-minor/latest+SHA (applied via push_to_ghcr.sh/verify_ghcr_aliases.sh).
- ci-core-quality.yml / ci-go-integration.yml / ci-integration-packs.yml: standard workspace-dependent CI (uses committed stubs); no direct BSR packages.
- ci-helm.yml: helm lint guardrail.

## Tilt (inner loop)
- SDK resources sync from BSR before tests (TS/Go/Py) and keep stubs committed.
- Services depend on workspace SDK copies; no direct BSR package consumption in Rings 1/2.

## Open items
- Add explicit scans to block buf.build/gen/... imports in Go/Py services; dist scans for BSR/core_proto paths where missing.
- Ensure policy scripts are wired into all relevant workflows (including new jobs, if added).
- Keep docs in 410/402–405 aligned with Option A.

# North Star: CNPG-Owned Postgres Credentials (Vault as Mirror, Not Authority)

## 1. Context

We run Postgres on Kubernetes using CloudNativePG (CNPG), with applications consuming database credentials via Kubernetes Secrets. Historically, some credentials have been **pushed from Vault into Kubernetes** using ExternalSecrets (e.g. `postgres-ameide-auth`), and those credentials were sometimes also managed directly in Postgres.

This split-brain model (Vault as “source of truth”, Postgres + CNPG as enforcement) has caused issues:

* Secrets in Vault and passwords in Postgres drifting out of sync.
* Outages when rotations or manual changes updated one side but not the other (e.g. Langfuse).
* Extra coupling between DB availability and the Vault/ExternalSecrets path.

We want a clear, opinionated model for **who owns Postgres app credentials** and how apps consume them.

---

## 2. North Star Statement

> **CloudNativePG is the single source of truth for Postgres roles and passwords.
> Applications read credentials from CNPG-managed Kubernetes Secrets.
> Vault is optional and may mirror these secrets, but never drives them.**

In other words:

* CNPG + Kubernetes Secrets own **both** the credentials and the database roles.
* Vault integration is **downstream** (for visibility/audit), not upstream (for provisioning).

---

## 3. Design Principles

1. **CNPG as authority for credentials**

   * A single controller (CNPG) owns both:

     * The Postgres role (user/password in the DB).
     * The corresponding Kubernetes Secret (username/password, URIs).
   * The DB and Secret are always reconciled by the same operator.

2. **One Secret per app, managed in-cluster**

   * Each app (e.g. Langfuse, Temporal, Keycloak) has a dedicated DB user and Secret.
   * Apps only read from Kubernetes Secrets that CNPG knows about and reconciles.

3. **Superuser credentials are for operations only**

   * Superuser is kept in a separate Secret (e.g. `<cluster>-superuser`).
   * It is used only for bootstrap, maintenance, and emergency debugging — never for app connection strings.

4. **Rotation is driven via Secrets, not ad hoc SQL**

   * Password rotation happens by changing the Secret.
   * CNPG reconciles that change into the DB role.
   * Any rotation plan includes application restart / connection pool drain steps.

5. **Vault is a consumer, not a writer**

   * If Vault is required for audit/compliance:

     * It **reads** from CNPG-managed Secrets (via ESO / PushSecret) and stores them.
     * It does **not** push passwords back into CNPG-managed Secrets or directly into Postgres.

---

## 4. Target Architecture

### 4.1 Ownership model

* **Per-cluster:**

  * CNPG manages:

    * `<cluster>-superuser` Secret → `postgres` role.
    * `<cluster>-app` Secret → default low-privilege app user (optional, if we use it).
* **Per-application (preferred):**

  * For each app needing DB access (e.g. `langfuse`, `temporal`, `keycloak`):

    * A Postgres role is defined declaratively in `spec.managed.roles` (or equivalent mechanism).
    * That role is associated with a Kubernetes Secret, e.g. `<app>-db-auth`.
    * CNPG ensures that:

      * The role exists in the DB with the expected privileges.
      * The role’s password matches what is stored in the Secret.

**Result:** there is a tight, operator-controlled link between:

> “what’s in the Secret” ↔ “what the DB actually accepts”.

---

### 4.2 Secrets layout & naming

**Cluster-level:**

* `<cluster>-superuser`

  * `username: postgres`
  * `password: …`
  * For admin/maintenance only.
* `<cluster>-app` (optional default)

  * `username: <cluster>-app`
  * `password: …`
  * For simple use cases or legacy apps.

**App-level:**

* `<app>-db-auth`

  * `username: <app>`
  * `password: <strong random>`
  * Optionally:

    * `uri` / `jdbc-uri`
    * `pgpass`

Guideline:

* **New apps**: always use a dedicated `<app>-db-auth` Secret and role.
* **Existing shared “auth” secrets** (e.g. `postgres-ameide-auth`): migrate away toward per-app users.

---

### 4.3 Rotation model

* Rotation is initiated by updating the **Kubernetes Secret** (e.g. via External Secrets Operator’s `Password` generator, CI pipeline, or internal tool).
* CNPG:

  * Detects the Secret change.
  * Updates the corresponding Postgres role password.
* Platform team:

  * Coordinates app restart / connection pool drain where necessary.
  * Validates that new credentials are in use before retiring the old ones (if we use staged rotation).

Key points:

* No direct `ALTER ROLE ... PASSWORD` by hand without updating the Secret.
* No rotation that only changes Vault while leaving CNPG/DB stale.

---

### 4.4 Vault integration (optional)

If Vault is required:

* Use External Secrets **PushSecret** or equivalent to push CNPG Secrets into Vault.
* This provides:

  * Central visibility into DB credentials.
  * Vault-based audit on read access.
* What we explicitly **do not** do:

  * Vault **does not** write credentials into CNPG-managed Secrets.
  * Vault **does not** directly manage Postgres roles.

Conceptually:

> CNPG → Kubernetes Secret → (optional) Push → Vault

Not:

> Vault → ExternalSecret → Kubernetes Secret → CNPG / Postgres

---

### 4.5 Operational workflows

**New application:**

1. Define a managed role for the app in the CNPG Cluster spec (or follow the agreed template).
2. Create a Kubernetes Secret `<app>-db-auth` (or have ESO generate it).
3. Wire the app’s Deployment/Helm chart to read DB credentials from `<app>-db-auth`.
4. Grant the app’s role only the minimum required privileges.

**Password rotation:**

1. Trigger regeneration of the `<app>-db-auth` Secret (ESO / CI).
2. CNPG reconciles the new password into Postgres.
3. Restart the app or roll its pods to ensure they pick up the new credentials.
4. Confirm new connections succeed; optionally revoke any old/stale credentials.

**Incident handling:**

* If an app can’t connect due to auth failures:

  * First check the CNPG-managed Secret vs the role in Postgres.
  * Treat any divergent Vault values as **suspect**, not authoritative.

---

## 5. Scope & Non-Goals

**In scope:**

* Ownership and lifecycle of Postgres app users and passwords for CNPG-managed clusters.
* How applications should obtain and use database credentials.
* How Vault fits into this picture, if used.

**Out of scope (for now):**

* Non-Postgres secrets (e.g. API keys, other databases).
* Detailed RBAC design inside Vault.
* Cross-cluster secret replication patterns.
* Blue/green rotation schemes across multiple DB clusters.

These can be addressed separately, reusing the same general principle: the **service operator** that controls the resource (DB, cache, etc.) should own its credentials; Vault may mirror, not drive.

---

## 6. Migration Strategy (High-Level)

1. **Stop adding new Vault-authored DB credentials**

   * Freeze creation of new Vault-sourced Postgres users/secrets.
   * Mandate CNPG-owned credentials for all new services.

2. **Catalog existing patterns**

   * List clusters and apps currently using Vault-driven secrets (e.g. `postgres-ameide-auth`).
   * Identify which apps use shared credentials vs per-app credentials.

3. **Introduce CNPG-owned equivalents**

   * For each app:

     * Create a dedicated CNPG-managed role and Secret `<app>-db-auth`.
     * Grant appropriate privileges.

4. **Cut apps over**

   * Update app configs/Helm charts to read from the CNPG Secret.
   * Roll deployments and verify connectivity.
   * Monitor for errors.

5. **Optional: Mirror to Vault**

   * Configure PushSecret (or equivalent) to send CNPG Secrets to Vault for observability.
   * Document how teams can find DB credentials in Vault, with the caveat that Vault is **read-only** for these users.

6. **Retire legacy Vault-driven secrets**

   * Remove ExternalSecrets that were pushing credentials into CNPG.
   * Clean up unused Vault entries.

---

## 7. FAQ (for reviewers / stakeholders)

**Q: Why not keep Vault as the authority for DB passwords?**
A: Because we want a single controller to manage both the Postgres role and the Kubernetes Secret. With Vault as authority, we get two partially overlapping systems (Vault and CNPG) that can get out of sync, which is exactly what has caused outages.

**Q: Do we lose audit/compliance by not using Vault as the writer?**
A: No. Vault remains the audit surface for secret *access*. We simply change the direction of synchronisation: CNPG creates/owns credentials; Vault mirrors them for visibility and access logging.

**Q: Can we ever change passwords directly in Postgres?**
A: In emergencies, yes—but we must immediately update the corresponding Secret and reconcile back to the declarative state. The norm should be “change the Secret, let CNPG reconcile the DB”.

**Q: How does this affect developers?**
A: Developers point their app at “the CNPG secret name” for DB credentials. Behind the scenes, platform manages the lifecycle. From the app’s perspective, this is simpler and more consistent.

If you’d like, I can also turn this into a shorter ADR-style one-pager with an “Option A vs Option B” table and a final decision section.

---

## Current implementation status (dev)

- CNPG `platform-postgres-clusters` now declares managed roles and emits the app DB Secrets itself (platform/agents/agents_runtime/graph/transformation/threads/workflows/temporal/keycloak plus the base postgres auth). Secrets keep legacy names to avoid app changes.
- Vault-authored ExternalSecrets for those DB credentials were removed (foundation-vault-secrets-platform, foundation-vault-secrets-temporal, keycloak-db-credentials), eliminating the split-brain path; rollout-phase 250 now delivers both cluster and creds.
- Vault can be reintroduced later as a mirror (PushSecret) if needed, but is no longer authoritative for Postgres users/passwords.

### Status Update (2025-12-03)

> **Review finding:** The CNPG managed roles infrastructure is in place, but ExternalSecrets
> in `sources/values/_shared/foundation/foundation-vault-secrets-platform.yaml` still pull
> some credentials FROM Vault (e.g., `postgres-ameide-auth-sync`).

**Current state:**
- ✅ CNPG managed roles defined in `sources/values/_shared/data/platform-postgres-clusters.yaml`
- ✅ CNPG generates app-specific Secrets with connection strings
- ⚠️ Some ExternalSecrets still sync DB credentials from Vault → Kubernetes
- ❌ No PushSecrets implemented for CNPG → Vault mirroring (audit/compliance)

**Gap:** Authority model not fully switched. CNPG infrastructure ready, but some Vault→K8s
ExternalSecrets remain active. These should be removed to achieve the documented north star.

**Next steps:**
1. Remove remaining Vault→K8s ExternalSecrets for DB credentials
2. Optionally add PushSecrets for K8s→Vault mirroring (read-only audit trail)

### Status Update (2025-12-05)

> **Complete**: Per-environment unique passwords now generated via Helm lookup+randAlphaNum pattern.

The north star goal has been achieved - CNPG/Helm is now the single authority for Postgres credentials:

**Implementation:**
- Template: `sources/charts/foundation/operators-config/postgres_clusters/templates/app-secrets.yaml`
- Commit: `d10ab77`

**How it works:**
```yaml
{{- $existingSecret := lookup "v1" "Secret" $namespace $secretName -}}
{{- $password := "" -}}
{{- if .password -}}
  {{- $password = .password -}}
{{- else if $existingSecret -}}
  {{- $password = index $existingSecret.data "password" | default "" | b64dec -}}
{{- end -}}
{{- if not $password -}}
  {{- $password = randAlphaNum 32 -}}
{{- end -}}
```

**Final state:**
- ✅ CNPG managed roles defined in values
- ✅ Helm generates unique 32-char passwords per namespace (first install)
- ✅ Helm preserves existing passwords on upgrade (via `lookup`)
- ✅ No hardcoded `dbpassword` in shared values
- ✅ Each environment (dev/staging/prod) has unique database credentials
- ✅ No Vault→K8s ExternalSecrets for DB credentials (authority is Helm, not Vault)
- ⚪ Optional: PushSecrets for Vault mirroring (not implemented - deemed unnecessary for now)

**Verification:**
```bash
# Passwords should be different across environments
kubectl get secret postgres-ameide-auth -n ameide-dev -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
kubectl get secret postgres-ameide-auth -n ameide-staging -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
kubectl get secret postgres-ameide-auth -n ameide-prod -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
```

**Rotation procedure:**
1. Delete the target secret: `kubectl delete secret <name> -n <namespace>`
2. Sync ArgoCD app: `argocd app sync <app-name>`
3. Helm regenerates with new random password
4. CNPG reconciles the new password to Postgres role
5. Restart dependent applications to pick up new credentials

### Status Update (2025-12-05) - Inference Service Migration

> **Complete**: Migrated inference service from Vault-driven ExternalSecrets to CNPG-owned credentials.

The inference service was the **last remaining service** using Vault-driven ExternalSecrets for database credentials.

**Changes (commit `332bb87`):**
- Added `inference` role to CNPG `managed.roles`
- Added `inference` appUser to `credentials.appUsers` (database: `langgraph`)
- Updated `langgraph` database owner from `dbuser` to `inference`
- Added `inference` secret template to `app-secrets.yaml`
- Split ExternalSecret: DB credentials now from CNPG, API keys still from Vault

**Files modified:**
- `sources/values/_shared/data/platform-postgres-clusters.yaml`
- `sources/charts/foundation/operators-config/postgres_clusters/templates/app-secrets.yaml`
- `sources/values/_shared/apps/inference.yaml`

**Secret architecture:**
- `inference-db-credentials` - CNPG-managed (32-char password, connection URIs)
- `inference-api-credentials` - Vault-synced (LangSmith, OpenAI, Langfuse API keys)

**Current state - all services on CNPG:**
| Service | Secret | Template |
|---------|--------|----------|
| platform | platform-db-credentials | platform |
| agents | agents-db-secret | agents |
| agents-runtime | agents-runtime-db-secret | agents-runtime |
| graph | graph-db-credentials | graph |
| transformation | transformation-db-credentials | transformation |
| threads | threads-db-credentials | threads |
| workflows | workflows-db-secret | workflows |
| temporal | temporal-db-env | temporal-env |
| temporal-visibility | temporal-visibility-db-env | temporal-visibility-env |
| plausible | plausible-db-credentials | plausible |
| keycloak | keycloak-db-credentials | keycloak |
| **inference** | **inference-db-credentials** | **inference** |

✅ **North star achieved**: All 12 application services now use CNPG-owned database credentials.

## 413-vault-bootstrap-readiness.md

# Vault bootstrap readiness and rollout bands

Context: We need Vault to stay in the post-runtime band (155) while avoiding a deadlock where Argo CD waits for Vault to be Ready before it will apply the bootstrap Job that initializes/unseals it.

Decision:
- Keep `foundation-vault-core` in rollout-phase 150 (runtime) and `foundation-vault-bootstrap` in rollout-phase 155 (post-runtime), preserving the band semantics from backlog/387.
- Relax Vault readiness to treat sealed/uninitialized as HTTP 200 by using `/v1/sys/health?standbyok=true&perfstandbyok=true&sealedcode=200&uninitcode=200` so Argo CD can advance into 155 and run the bootstrap.
- Increase the bootstrap CronJob cadence to every minute (`*/1 * * * *`) to minimize time-to-unseal.

Rationale:
- HashiCorp explicitly documents overriding `/sys/health` codes in their Helm chart to report Ready even when sealed/uninitialized for environments that rely on automation to init/unseal.
- This breaks the RollingSync deadlock without collapsing the band model (runtime at *50, bootstrap at *55).

Notes and guardrails:
- “Ready” now means “listening and can be initialized/unsealed,” not “serving.” Communicate this to operators; keep liveness stricter/off so a permanently sealed Vault still surfaces as unhealthy in other signals.
- Long-term cleaner path is auto-unseal (KMS/HSM) with strict health codes restored and bootstrap limited to auth/config/fixtures.
- CronJob name: `foundation-vault-bootstrap-vault-bootstrap`; manual trigger (for immediate run) stays `kubectl -n vault create job vault-bootstrap-manual --from=cronjob/foundation-vault-bootstrap-vault-bootstrap`.

## 414-quality-gate-refactor.md

# 414 – Unified Quality Gate & Policy Layout

## Objective
Document the consolidated structure for policy guardrails, local/CI runners, and the end-to-end quality checks that gate merges, images, and packages.

## Current Structure
- **Entrypoint runner:** `scripts/policy/run_all.sh`
  - Default channel: `workspace` (set `SDK_POLICY_CHANNEL=release` for release semantics).
  - Runs all policy guardrails and reports aggregated status (no early exit).
- **Policy scripts (under `scripts/policy/`):**
  - `enforce_proto_generation.sh` — only `packages/ameide_core_proto` may contain `buf.gen*.yaml`.
  - `check_proto_source.sh` — `proto-source.json` matches sync script defaults (TS/Go/Py).
  - `enforce_proto_imports.sh` — enforces SDK-only proto usage; blocks direct workspace/BSR stubs; scans built artifacts and Dockerfiles for frozen-lock installs.
  - `check_proto_workspace_barrels.sh` — service proto barrels must import `@ameideio/ameide-sdk-ts/proto.js`.
  - `check_lock_hygiene.sh` — Go/Py/TS lock/import hygiene (no BSR stubs, required replaces, no PyPI pins).
  - `check_docker_sources.sh` — Dockerfiles must copy workspace SDKs; no registry fetches/core_proto copies; no SKIP_SDK_SYNC.
  - `check_go_option_a.sh` — blocks legacy sdk/go cache or sync scripts.
  - `check_go_replaces.sh` — in `release` channel forbids ameide-sdk-go replaces; `workspace` channel logs expected replaces.
  - `enforce_build_secrets.sh` — BuildKit secrets required (no ARG/ENV tokens).
  - TS helpers in `scripts/policy/ts/`: `rewrite_lock.sh`, `rewrite_manifests.py` for publish-time rewrites.
- **Local gate:** `scripts/ci/run_core_quality_local.sh` mirrors CI steps (policy runner + lint/typecheck/tests).
- **Docs:** `docs/quality-checks.md` summarizes the structure and entrypoints.

## Workflows using the new runner
- `.github/workflows/ci-core-quality.yml` — runs `scripts/policy/run_all.sh` plus lint/typecheck/tests (JS/TS, Ruff, mypy (soft), Jest suites, Go/Py tests).
- `.github/workflows/cd-packages.yml` — calls `scripts/policy/run_all.sh` before SDK build/test/publish.
- `.github/workflows/cd-service-images.yml` — calls `scripts/policy/run_all.sh` before image builds.

## What we test end to end (Core Quality Gate)
1) **Policy guardrails:** proto generation, proto source alignment, SDK-only imports, barrel checks, lock hygiene, Docker SDK source enforcement, Go Option A, build secrets.
2) **Linting:** ESLint (workspace fan-out), Ruff.
3) **Type checks:** `pnpm typecheck`; `uvx mypy --config-file mypy.ini packages` (continues-on-error as in CI).
4) **JS tests:** `services/www_ameide_platform` unit + integration; `packages/ameide_sdk_ts` unit + integration with coverage.
5) **Python tests:** inference SDK integration (`services/inference/__tests__/integration/test_sdk_metadata_retry.py`); package-wide pytest with coverage.
6) **Go tests:** `packages/ameide_sdk_go` (excluding generated `/gen/`).
7) **Helm lint:** `scripts/infra/lint-image-values.py` (skips known third_party chart defaults).

## Channel behavior
- `SDK_POLICY_CHANNEL=workspace` (default): allows expected workspace replaces; skips some release-only checks (e.g., ameide_sdk.generated in Python).
- `SDK_POLICY_CHANNEL=release`: stricter (no Go replaces; full proto import enforcement).

## Next Steps / Follow-ups
- Decide if release channel should be run in CI pre-merge or only on publish.
- Optionally add a short CLI wrapper (`bin/core-quality`) that runs the local gate with common flags (e.g., `--skip-helm-lint`).

# 415 – Implementation Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-11-29
**Status:** ✅ LARGELY IMPLEMENTED with minor gaps

> ⚠️ **Legacy scope:** This report verifies the old k3d-based dev registry workflow. Remote-first development now targets the shared AKS cluster (see [435-remote-first-development.md](435-remote-first-development.md)), so treat the findings below as historical documentation rather than the current dev path.

## Executive Summary

The k3d dev registry end-to-end flow has been successfully implemented with most critical components in place. The registry is operational, images are being built and pushed, and the GitOps values are correctly configured. A few minor gaps remain in the bootstrap configuration.

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED Components

- **Image Pulls:** ✅ No `ImagePullBackOff` errors detected
- **ArgoCD Apps:** ✅ Most Synced (some Progressing, expected during rollout)

---

## ⚠️ GAPS Identified

### 1. Missing Bootstrap Config Fields
**Issue:** [infra/environments/dev/bootstrap.yaml](../infra/environments/dev/bootstrap.yaml) does not include registry configuration fields.

**Current state:**
```yaml
cluster:
  context: k3d-ameide
  type: k3d
# Missing:
#   registry:
#     name: ameide.localhost
#     port: 5001
```

**Expected (per backlog):**
```yaml
cluster:
  context: k3d-ameide
  type: k3d
  registry:
    name: ameide.localhost
    port: 5001
```

**Impact:** Low - Bootstrap script uses hardcoded defaults ([bootstrap-v2.sh:384-386](../tools/bootstrap/bootstrap-v2.sh#L384-L386)):
```bash
if [[ -z "${K3D_REGISTRY_PORT}" ]]; then
  K3D_REGISTRY_PORT="5001"
fi
```

**However:** The `load_config()` function at [bootstrap-v2.sh:249-256](../tools/bootstrap/bootstrap-v2.sh#L249-L256) **does** support reading these values:
```bash
value=$(yq -er '.cluster.registry.name // ""' "${CONFIG_FILE}" 2>/dev/null || true)
if [[ -n "${value}" ]]; then
  K3D_REGISTRY_NAME="${value}"
fi
value=$(yq -er '.cluster.registry.port // ""' "${CONFIG_FILE}" 2>/dev/null || true)
if [[ -n "${value}" ]]; then
  K3D_REGISTRY_PORT="${value}"
fi
```

**Recommendation:** Add registry config to bootstrap.yaml for explicitness and documentation.

### 2. Documentation Reference
**Issue:** Backlog mentions entry point as:
```bash
tools/bootstrap/bootstrap-v2.sh --config infra/environments/dev/bootstrap.yaml
```

But the config file path is actually:
```bash
infra/environments/dev/bootstrap.yaml ✅ (exists)
```

**Impact:** None - Documentation is correct.

## 📝 Recommendations

### High Priority
None - system is operational.

### Low Priority
1. **Add registry config to bootstrap.yaml** for explicitness:
   ```yaml
   cluster:
     registry:
       name: ameide.localhost
       port: 5001
   ```

2. **Consider adding verification step** to bootstrap script:
   ```bash
   verify_registry_populated() {
     local count
     count=$(docker exec k3d-ameide.localhost ls /var/lib/registry/.../ameide 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
     if (( count < 10 )); then
       log "WARNING: Registry has only ${count} images; expected 15+"
     fi
   }
   ```

3. **Document the steady state** in a README:
   - Expected registry contents
   - How to verify post-bootstrap
   - Troubleshooting steps

---

## ✅ Conclusion

**Implementation Status: 95% Complete**

The k3d dev registry end-to-end flow is **fully operational** and meets all critical objectives from backlog #415. The system:
- ✅ Uses a single dev registry endpoint
- ✅ Pushes all images (no import)
- ✅ Configures k3s for HTTP pulls
- ✅ Uses hyphenated naming consistently
- ✅ Integrates with bootstrap/build scripts
- ✅ Has correct GitOps values

The only gap is **cosmetic**: the bootstrap.yaml config file is missing explicit registry fields, but the system works correctly due to sensible defaults.

**Recommendation:** Ship as-is. Optionally add registry config to bootstrap.yaml for documentation purposes.

## 415-k3d-dev-registry-e2e.md

# 415 – k3d dev registry end-to-end flow (implementation notes)

> ⚠️ **Deprecated workflow:** These notes cover the legacy k3d dev registry. The supported approach is now remote-first AKS + Telepresence (backlog/435). Keep this file for archival purposes only.

## Objectives
- Single dev registry endpoint: `k3d-ameide.localhost:5001/ameide`, used by builders, GitOps values, and cluster pulls.
- No `k3d image import`; every dev build is pushed to the registry.
- k3s/containerd is configured to use the HTTP registry (no HTTPS fallback), so pulls succeed out-of-the-box after bootstrap.
- Image naming uses hyphens across the fleet (`agents-runtime`, `www-ameide`, `www-ameide-platform`, etc.); avoid underscore repos to match GitOps values and containerd pulls.

## Bootstrap mechanics
- Entry point: `tools/bootstrap/bootstrap-v2.sh --config infra/environments/dev/bootstrap.yaml`.
- Defaults:
  - `K3D_REGISTRY_PORT=5001`
  - `BUILD_IMAGES=1` (unless `--skip-build-images`)
  - `IMPORT_IMAGES=0`, `PUSH_IMAGES=1`
- k3d creation (`tools/bootstrap/lib/k3d.sh`):
  - Registry: `k3d registry create ameide.localhost --port 0.0.0.0:${K3D_REGISTRY_PORT}` (host 5001 → container 5000).
- Cluster: `k3d cluster create ... --registry-use k3d-ameide.localhost:5001` with `--disable-default-registry-endpoint` for server+agent.
- Registry config: mirrors `k3d-ameide.localhost:5001` to `http://k3d-ameide.localhost:5001` (k3s containerd treats it as HTTP).
- Build stage (if not skipped):
  - Script: `scripts/build-all-images-dev.sh`
  - Registry envs: `AMEIDE_REGISTRY_HOST=k3d-ameide.localhost:5001`, namespace `ameide`; push endpoint default `AMEIDE_REGISTRY_PUSH_HOST=localhost:5001` so the devcontainer talks to the host-published registry port.
  - Tags: `k3d-ameide.localhost:5001/ameide/<service>:dev` (plus local `ameide/<service>:dev`) — registry content is the same regardless of whether the push endpoint is `localhost` or `k3d-ameide.localhost`.
  - Image names are hyphenated in tags to match GitOps values (e.g., `agents-runtime`, `inference-gateway`, `workflows-runtime`, `workflow-worker`, `www-ameide`, `www-ameide-platform`).
  - Concurrency: `JOBS=$(nproc)` (override with `JOBS=`).
  - Secrets: BuildKit secrets from `.env` (e.g., `PKG_GITHUB_COM_TOKEN`, `GHCR_TOKEN`).
  - Outputs: per-service logs under `artifacts/image-build-logs/*_dev.log` and `build-summary-dev.csv`.
- Separation of loops:
  - Argo CD path: uses the bootstrap-built images pushed to `k3d-ameide.localhost:5001/ameide` and deploys them in-cluster.
  - Tilt path: inner-loop builds run from the devcontainer and can push/tag independently (still expected to use the same registry/values); Argo does not consume Tilt-built artifacts.
- GitOps apply:
  - Dev/local values already point to `k3d-ameide.localhost:5001/ameide/...:dev` with `pullPolicy: IfNotPresent`, no pull secrets.
  - Argo applies apps; kubelet pulls from the registry directly.

## Expected steady state
- `docker port k3d-ameide.localhost` → `5000/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:5001`
- Registry populated: `docker exec k3d-ameide.localhost ls /var/lib/registry/docker/registry/v2/repositories` lists `ameide/*`.
- Pods pull without `ImagePullBackOff` or `manifest unknown`.

## Common failure modes
1) **Skipped build after reset**  
   - Symptom: registry empty; k3d registry logs show 404 `manifest unknown` for `:dev`.  
   - Fix: rerun `scripts/build-all-images-dev.sh` (let it finish), then Argo resync or wait for kubelet retries.
2) **Host port collision**  
   - Symptom: `k3d registry create ... port ... bind: address already in use`.  
   - Fix: free host port 5001 or change `K3D_REGISTRY_PORT` + all defaults (build script + GitOps values) in lockstep, recreate k3d, rebuild/push.
3) **HTTPS fallback**  
   - Symptom: `http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client`.  
   - Fix: ensure `--disable-default-registry-endpoint` is present for k3s, and registries mirror uses `http://...:5001`.
4) **Partial pushes (interrupted build)**  
   - Symptom: `build-summary-dev.csv` says success, but registry has no manifests; logs end with endless `Waiting` on push.  
   - Fix: rerun `scripts/build-all-images-dev.sh` without interruption.
5) **Push endpoint mismatch (push hangs)**  
   - Symptom: `docker push k3d-ameide.localhost:5001/...` hangs on `Waiting` because the devcontainer resolves the hostname to the registry container IP (no host port).  
   - Fix: push via the host-published port (`AMEIDE_REGISTRY_PUSH_HOST=localhost:5001 scripts/build-all-images-dev.sh`) or add `127.0.0.1 k3d-ameide.localhost` to `/etc/hosts` so pushes reach the host port 5001.
6) **Underscore vs hyphen repos**  
   - Symptom: pod ImagePullBackOff with “not found” even though the image was built (e.g., GitOps uses `www-ameide` but registry has `www_ameide`).  
   - Fix: use hyphenated image names in build tags (`agents-runtime`, `inference-gateway`, `workflow-worker`, `workflows-runtime`, `www-ameide`, `www-ameide-platform`) so tags match GitOps values.

## Minimal verification checklist (post-bootstrap)
- Registry contents: `docker exec k3d-ameide.localhost ls /var/lib/registry/docker/registry/v2/repositories/ameide`
- Pods: `kubectl get pods -n ameide | grep -v Running` (ensure no ImagePullBackOff)
- Argo apps: `kubectl get applications -n argocd` (should be Synced/Healthy or Progressing for normal rollouts)
- Pull test: `ctr -n k8s.io images pull k3d-ameide.localhost:5001/ameide/<service>:dev` from a k3d node container if needed.

## Scope

This story covers the **Argo CD / GitOps dev path only**:

- Ensure the k3d dev cluster is created with a local registry (`k3d-ameide.localhost:5001/ameide`) and that k3s/containerd is configured to pull from it over HTTP.
- Ensure dev bootstrap builds and **pushes** images for all services to that registry.
- Ensure dev GitOps values reference `k3d-ameide.localhost:5001/ameide/<service>:dev`.

Tilt’s inner-loop build path and its registry configuration (`registry.localhost:32000` by default) are out of scope for this story and are tracked under 373.

> Staging/prod remain unchanged here: they continue to use the cloud registry (GHCR/ACR) with pull secrets and Argo-only deployment flows; no Tilt involvement.

## 416-helm-unit-tests.md

# Helm Unit Tests (416)

**Status**: Draft  
**Intent**: Introduce chart-level unit tests with `helm-unittest` plus optional `kubeconform` schema checks so Helm changes fail fast before Argo or cluster apply.

> ⚠️ **Registry update:** Image-registry assertions referencing `k3d-ameide.localhost:5001` describe the retired local workflow. Dev/staging/prod baselines now pull the repositories and tags defined in `ameide-gitops` (published to GitHub Container Registry); update the suites so they validate `ghcr.io/ameide/...` entries and the GitOps-driven tag patterns before enforcing them.

## Scope
- All first-party charts under `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/charts/**` (exclude `third_party/`).
- Runner script in `scripts/ci` to install the plugin and execute suites across charts.
- Seed suites for high-risk charts, then expand chart-by-chart using a shared pattern.

## Implementation status
- Runner added: `scripts/ci/test_helm_unittests.sh` (pinned plugin v1.0.3, skips charts without suites, configurable glob).
- Suites added:
  - `apps/platform`: db secret required, CNPG secret wiring, service/container port alignment.
  - `platform-layers/db-migrations`: enabled/disabled toggle, required secrets (fail fast), envFrom order, Flyway defaults.
  - `foundation/operators-config/postgres_clusters`: managed roles to per-app secrets (CNPG model).
  - `foundation/operators-config/postgres_clusters`: namespace override coverage.
  - `platform-layers/pgadmin`: ExternalSecret target defaults and data wiring.
  - `foundation/helm-test-jobs`: hook annotations, hook delete policy, multiple job names/weights.
  - `apps/inference-gateway`: HTTPRoute toggle/hostnames and SecurityPolicy gating.
  - `foundation/vault-bootstrap`: CronJob name/schedule.
  - Image tag/registry tests: `apps/workflows`, `apps/agents`, `apps/agents-runtime`, `apps/inference` (k3d dev registry, no underscores).
  - `foundation/vault-webhook-certs`: CA + serving Certificate presence.
- Templates hardened: db-migrations now `fail`s when `migrations.existingSecrets` is empty.
- Runner passes on current suites (`bash scripts/ci/test_helm_unittests.sh`).

## Decisions
- Test files live at `tests/*_test.yaml` in each chart root (plugin default).
- Runner discovers `Chart.yaml` roots (not `tests/` dirs) and invokes `helm unittest <chart> --file 'tests/**/*_test.yaml'`.
- Values are passed with `--values/-v` or `values:` inside suites. `-f/--file` remains reserved for test suite globs.
- Negative tests rely on `required`/`fail` guards in templates so `failedTemplate` assertions can catch missing inputs.
- Kubeconform (optional gate) validates `helm template` output with cached CRD schemas for CNPG Cluster, ExternalSecret, Gateway API, etc.

## Initial Test Matrix
- `apps/platform`: require `postgresql.auth.existingSecret`; verify Deployment envFrom/secretKeyRef wiring and service port matches values; render with repo `_shared` + `local` values via `--values`.
- `platform-layers/db-migrations`: `migrations.enabled` toggle; fail when `migrations.existingSecrets` is empty; assert envFrom order and Flyway env defaults.
- `foundation/operators-config/postgres_clusters`: cover new `cluster`/`managed.roles` schema and legacy `.Values.ameide` fallback; require role names/passwordSecret.name; namespace override honored.
- `apps/inference-gateway`: `httpRoute.enabled` on/off; hostnames templating; default gateway namespace/section; SecurityPolicy gated on CORS flag.
- `foundation/helm-test-jobs`: single-test shorthand (`command`/`script`) produces a Job with `helm.sh/hook: test` and chart-default Argo hook delete policy; list form renders distinct job names/weights.
- ExternalSecret emitters (e.g., `platform-layers/pgadmin`, app charts): assert target `creationPolicy`/`deletionPolicy`/template defaults and required remote keys block rendering.

## Runner Outline
1. Install `helm-unittest` plugin if missing.
2. Find charts: `find gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/charts -name Chart.yaml -not -path '*/third_party/*'`.
3. For each chart dir: `helm unittest <dir> --file 'tests/**/*_test.yaml'` (default glob ok if no subdirs).
4. Optional: `helm template <dir> ... | kubeconform -strict -summary -schema-location default -schema-location <cached CRD schemas>`.

## Follow-Ups
- Add CI job alongside `scripts/ci/lint_helm_charts.sh` to run the runner; cache `~/.cache/helm` and `~/.cache/kubeconform`.
- Expand suites to remaining charts as they change; keep “render with repo values” coverage in sync with ApplicationSet `_shared` + env-specific value files.
- Document local invocation in repo README (helm lint + helm unittest + optional kubeconform).

## Risks / Mitigations
- **Template guards missing**: add `required`/`fail` where negative tests expect failure.  
- **CRD schemas unavailable**: host cached schemas in CI artifact or fall back to default `kubernetesjsonschema.dev` with retries.  
- **Plugin drift**: pin `helm-unittest` version in the runner to avoid breaking changes.

## Concrete suites to codify (per chart)

### foundation/operators-config/postgres_clusters (CNPG)
- managed_roles_test: per-app roles point at `<app>-db-auth` secrets; superuser/app secrets default to cluster name.
- legacy_fallback_test: `.Values.ameide` populates `spec.managed.roles` identically to new schema.
- cnpg_schema_valid (optional): render a representative Cluster and validate with kubeconform + CNPG schema.

### apps/platform (consumer of CNPG creds)
- db_secret_required: missing `postgresql.auth.existingSecret` fails (failedTemplate).
- db_secret_wiring: with `postgresql.auth.existingSecret: platform-db-auth`, Deployment `envFrom` and `env[].valueFrom.secretKeyRef` reference that secret and do not reference legacy vault secrets.
- service_port_tracks_values: overridden `service.port` matches Service port and containerPort.

### platform-layers/db-migrations
- migrations_toggle: `enabled=false` renders no Job; `enabled=true` with minimal secrets renders one Job.
- secrets_required: `enabled=true` + empty `migrations.existingSecrets` fails (failedTemplate).
- envfrom_order_and_flyway_defaults: envFrom preserves secret order; Flyway env vars present with defaults and point to the DB secret.

### foundation/vault-core
- readiness_probe_relaxed: readinessProbe hits `/v1/sys/health` with `standbyok`, `perfstandbyok`, `sealedcode=200`, `uninitcode=200`.
- liveness_probe_policy: livenessProbe is stricter or omitted per decision.
- rollout_phase_label: rollout-phase label/annotation equals `"150"`.

### foundation/vault-bootstrap
- cron_schedule: CronJob schedule is `"*/1 * * * *"`.
- stable_name: CronJob name matches expected stable value (manual trigger friendly).
- rollout_phase_label: rollout-phase label/annotation equals `"155"`.

### dev registry image naming (per first-ring app: agents-runtime, inference-gateway, workflows-runtime, workflow-worker, www-ameide, www-ameide-platform, etc.)
- dev_image_registry: main container image matches `^k3d-ameide\.localhost:5001/ameide/<hyphenated-name>:dev$`.
- no_underscores: image string does not contain `_`.

### apps/inference-gateway
- httproute_toggle: disabled -> no HTTPRoute/SecurityPolicy; enabled -> exactly one of each.
- hostnames_and_defaults: hostnames match values; parentRefs namespace/section use defaults when unset.
- securitypolicy_gated: SecurityPolicy appears only when CORS/auth flag is on and references same hostnames/gateway as the HTTPRoute.

### foundation/helm-test-jobs
- command_shorthand: single test renders one Job with `helm.sh/hook: test`, Argo hook annotation, and default hook-delete policy.
- list_renders_distinct: multiple tests render uniquely named Jobs (and weights if supported).

### ExternalSecret emitters (e.g., platform-layers/pgadmin; pattern applies to other charts)
- target_semantics: ExternalSecret has intended `target.creationPolicy`/`deletionPolicy` and template with expected keys (e.g., PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL/PASSWORD).
- remote_keys_required: missing required remote keys (email/password) fails via failedTemplate.
- schema_valid (optional): kubeconform against ExternalSecret CRD schema.

### Cross-cutting render smoke
- renders_with_repo_values: for each first-party chart, render with `_shared` + env values (as ApplicationSet does) and assert at least one expected resource with key labels/annotations (e.g., rollout-phase, app labels). Add kubeconform checks for CRD-heavy charts (CNPG Cluster, ExternalSecret, Gateway API).

## 417-envoy-route-tracking.md

# Backlog 417: Envoy Gateway route coverage

> **Related**: See [386-envoy-gateway-cert-tls-docs.md](386-envoy-gateway-cert-tls-docs.md) for TLS/cert-manager PKI, and [436-envoy-gateway-observability.md](436-envoy-gateway-observability.md) for telemetry (access logs to OTEL, Prometheus metrics).

> ⚠️ **Remote-first note:** The inventories below previously referred to a local k3d cluster. After [435-remote-first-development.md](435-remote-first-development.md), "dev" means the shared AKS namespace (`ameide-dev`) reached via Telepresence; treat any residual k3d wording as historical context.

- Goal: align all public app/frontends to Envoy Gateway (Gateway API HTTPRoute/GRPCRoute) and remove residual Ingress usage that breaks health.
- Actions:
  - Catalog current routes/hosts and their backends (gateway chart `additionalHttpRoutes` and route templates).
  - Move any remaining Ingress-based apps (e.g., Langfuse) to Gateway HTTPRoutes and disable their Helm Ingress stanzas.
  - Ensure className/parentRefs target the platform gateway and hosts/certs match env domains.
  - Add Argo health overrides if needed for Gateway resources; avoid relying on Ingress LB status.
  - Wire a control-plane smoke test that validates Envoy xDS PKI (server `envoy-gateway` issued by `envoy-gateway-ca`, which is issued by the dev root CA `ameidet-ca`) and Gateway API status (`Accepted=True`, `Programmed=True`) before treating routes as healthy.
  - Keep a single source of truth for routes (values files) and document expected hosts → services mapping.

## Implementation status

- Envoy Gateway chart is the single source of truth for shared routes; dev uses `_shared` + `local` values, staging/production use `_shared` + env-specific values.
- Plausible HTTPRoute restored (previously dropped by an empty `additionalHttpRoutes` override).
- All public app Ingress stanzas removed/disabled: Langfuse (staging/production) and prod Grafana now rely on Gateway; staging web frontends moved to HTTPRoutes.
- Keycloak is exposed via Gateway, but production renders two HTTPRoutes (auth.dev.ameide.io/auth.ameide.io → keycloak:4000 and auth.ameide.io → keycloak:8080); needs dedupe/port alignment.
- Duplicate HTTPRoutes exist for some hosts (prometheus/alertmanager/loki/tempo UI vs. base routes); consider consolidating to a single route per host.
- Local dev now renders a second HTTPS listener (`https-local`) plus dedicated HTTPRoutes for `www.local.ameide.io` and `platform.local.ameide.io`, so tilt-only releases stay isolated from the Argo baseline.
- The Envoy xDS certificate chain is now managed by `platform-cert-manager-config` (`ameidet-ca` root, `envoy-gateway-ca` intermediate, and `envoy`/`envoy-gateway` TLS secrets), and `platform-control-plane-smoke` asserts this PKI wiring and the `gateway/ameide` `Accepted=True, Programmed=True` conditions so broken xDS/TLS cannot hide behind green HTTPRoute inventories.

## 418-secrets-strategy-map.md

# 418 – Secrets strategy map & gaps

Purpose: single view of our current secrets posture, with pointers to the source docs and open gaps to close.

## Current pillars (source docs)
- Baseline stack and bootstrap: `README.md` — DevContainer/bootstrap seeds Argo repo creds, registry pull secrets, and relies on Vault + External Secrets to reconcile everything else post-apply.
- Database credentials authority: `backlog/412-cnpg-owned-postgres-greds.md` — CNPG owns Postgres roles/passwords and emits the Kubernetes Secrets; Vault may mirror via PushSecret but never writes back; rotation is driven by Secret changes.
- Secrets layer orchestration: `backlog/339-helmfile-refactor.md` — Layer 15 (“secrets & certificates”) runs `vault`, `vault-secrets` bundles, `cert-manager`, and `external-secrets` with per-environment `platform/15-secrets.values.yaml` toggles and a `secrets-smoke` job.
- Vault bootstrap readiness: `backlog/413-vault-bootstrap-readiness.md` — rollout bands keep Vault core at 150 and bootstrap at 155; `/sys/health` is relaxed to avoid Argo deadlock; bootstrap CronJob runs every minute.
- Service test guardrails: `backlog/347-service-tests-refactorings.md` — per-service ExternalSecrets are authoritative; test harnesses must run `scripts/vault/ensure-local-secrets.py` and consume the per-service templates (no inline Secrets/Azure KV).
- Build-time registry secrets: `backlog/391-buildkit-dev-registry-secrets.md` — GitHub/GHCR tokens are build-only via BuildKit secret mounts; no ARG/ENV token baking; Tilt/CI pass `--secret id=...` flags.

## Open gaps to address
- Document runtime secrets map: add an environment-scoped inventory (which Secrets come from Vault vs CNPG vs generators) to reduce spelunking; link it from Layer 15 values and service READMEs.
- Rotation runbooks: write concise rotation flows per secret class (CNPG-owned DB users, Vault-sourced API keys, TLS certs) and where to trigger (Secret update vs Vault path vs cert-manager).
- Drift detection: define how we detect stale ExternalSecrets/PushSecrets and CNPG↔Postgres divergence (e.g., ESO status alerts, CNPG role/secret parity checks).
- Testing gates: expand CI/Tilt checks to fail fast when required Secret stores are missing (e.g., enforce `ensure-local-secrets.py` ran, block builds if BuildKit tokens absent rather than surfacing 401s).
- Mirroring policy: codify when we push CNPG-managed Secrets into Vault (namespaces/paths, retention) and ensure apps treat Vault as read-only; add examples in the CNPG doc.
- Legacy footprints: audit for remaining Vault-authored DB creds or inline Kubernetes Secrets in charts/tests and replace with CNPG-owned or per-service ExternalSecrets.

## Next steps
- [ ] Publish the environment-level secrets inventory and link it from Layer 15 values and service READMEs.
- [ ] Add rotation runbooks per secret class and surface them alongside the owning chart/ExternalSecret.
- [ ] Add automated drift/health checks (ESO status alerts, CNPG role/secret parity) and wire them into observability.
- [ ] Harden CI/Tilt prechecks for missing BuildKit tokens and unsatisfied `ensure-local-secrets.py` pre-reqs.
- [ ] Write a short mirroring policy for CNPG→Vault PushSecret usage and attach it to `backlog/412-cnpg-owned-postgres-greds.md`.
- [ ] Complete the audit to remove any remaining Vault-authored DB users/secrets or inline Secrets in charts/tests.

## Snapshot
- Latest inventory: `backlog/418-secrets-strategy-map-snapshot.md` (auto-generated).
- Regenerate with `python3 scripts/secrets_inventory.py` (writes Markdown with embedded JSON by default; use `--output` for a raw `.json`).
- Script lives at `scripts/secrets_inventory.py` and scans repo YAML for Secret/ExternalSecret/PushSecret/SealedSecret resources; template files that cannot parse record best-effort metadata and list a parse error.

> **Note (2025-12-03):** `scripts/secrets_inventory.py` was planned but not yet implemented.
> For manual audit, use: `grep -r "kind: Secret\|kind: ExternalSecret\|kind: PushSecret" sources/`

## 419-clickhouse-argocd-resiliency.md

# 419 – ClickHouse + Argo CD resiliency and rollout contract

**Status:** Documented / stabilized  
**Scope:** data-clickhouse CRDs/operator/CHI under Argo CD  
**Date:** 2025-11-29

## Configuration snapshot
- **Components & waves (Argo ApplicationSet `ameide-dev`):**
  - Wave 210: `data-crds-clickhouse` (`environments/dev/components/data/crds/clickhouse/component.yaml`)
  - Wave 220: `foundation-clickhouse-operator`
  - Wave 250: `data-clickhouse` (`environments/dev/components/data/core/clickhouse/component.yaml`)
- **CRDs (vendor contract):** Four Altinity CRDs applied via `data-crds-clickhouse` (raw-manifests chart), each as a separate file vendored from the Altinity 0.25.5 release:
  - `clickhouseinstallations.clickhouse.altinity.com`
  - `clickhouseinstallationtemplates.clickhouse.altinity.com`
  - `clickhousekeeperinstallations.clickhouse-keeper.altinity.com`
  - `clickhouseoperatorconfigurations.clickhouse.altinity.com`
  Value file: `sources/values/_shared/data/data-crds-clickhouse.yaml` lists all four `manifestFiles`.
- **Operator:** Deployed by `foundation-clickhouse-operator` (Altinity operator chart). The data ClickHouse chart has `operator.enabled: false` to avoid double-installation.
- **CHI runtime:** `data-clickhouse` uses Altinity `clickhouse` chart with pinned image `clickhouse/clickhouse-server:25.10.2-alpine`, 1 shard/replica, PVC 20Gi, secrets via ExternalSecret `clickhouse-auth`.
- **Health:** Custom Argo Lua health for `ClickHouseInstallation` (reads `spec.stop/suspend`, `status.status`, `status.error/errors`; Healthy when `status.status == "Completed"`). OpenLibs enabled.
- **Orphans:** Project-level ignores for operator-emitted CHI children (Service/StatefulSet/PDB/ConfigMap with `chi-*`) to prevent orphan warnings; warn=false in `project-ameide`.
- **Sync options:** SSA disabled on CRD app and CHI app (client-side apply). `SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true` remains on CHI app.

## Issues observed
1) **Incomplete CRD bundle**  
   - Only `clickhouseoperatorconfigurations` existed on fresh clusters; CHI CRD was missing. Argo sync failed with “ClickHouseInstallation not found”.
2) **Argo SSA/diff panics on CRDs**  
   - Enabling `ServerSideApply=true` on CHI/CRD apps triggered Argo’s known nil-pointer in server-side diff for CRDs; left `runtime error: invalid memory address` in `operationState.message`.
3) **Orphan warnings**  
   - Operator-owned CHI children flagged as orphans; warnings persisted.
4) **Stale operationState**  
   - After fixes, Argo still displayed old panic text until `operationState` was cleared and app refreshed.

## Remediations applied
- **CRDs:** Vendored all four Altinity CRDs individually (`clickhouse-crd-*.yaml`); `data-crds-clickhouse` now applies all four. Verified via `kubectl get crd | grep clickhouse`.
- **SSA:** Disabled SSA on `data-crds-clickhouse` and `data-clickhouse` to avoid the Argo CRD diff panic path (client-side apply only).
- **Orphans:** Added project-level ignore patterns for `chi-*` Service/StatefulSet/PDB/ConfigMap, `warn: false`, so operator-managed children no longer raise warnings.
- **Cleanup:** Cleared stale `operationState` once after fixes; subsequent syncs are clean.
- **Files touched (authoritative):**
  - CRDs: `sources/charts/foundation/common/raw-manifests/files/clickhouse-crd-{chi,chit,chk,chopcfg}.yaml`
  - CRD values: `sources/values/_shared/data/data-crds-clickhouse.yaml`
  - CHI component: `environments/dev/components/data/core/clickhouse/component.yaml`
  - CHI values: `sources/values/_shared/data/data-clickhouse.yaml` (+ `sources/values/dev/data/data-clickhouse.yaml`)
  - Health script & OpenLibs: `sources/values/common/argocd.yaml`, `environments/dev/argocd/ops/argocd-cm.yaml`
  - Orphan ignores: `environments/dev/argocd/project-ameide.yaml`

## Reproducible rollout (new cluster)
1. Argo syncs `data-crds-clickhouse` → all four CRDs present.
2. Argo syncs `foundation-clickhouse-operator` → operator ready.
3. Argo syncs `data-clickhouse` → CHI created; health goes Healthy when `status=Completed`.
4. Downstream apps (e.g., Langfuse) proceed; DNS `clickhouse-data-clickhouse.ameide.svc.cluster.local` resolves.

## Current state
- `data-crds-clickhouse`: Synced/Healthy.  
- `data-clickhouse`: Synced/Healthy; CHI `STATUS: Completed`.  
- No orphan warnings; SSA off for CRD/CHI apps; health script active.

## Follow-ups (if desired)
- When Argo upgrades to a version that fixes SSA/CRD diff nil-pointer, re-test SSA on CHI/CRD apps.
- Keep CRD files in sync with Altinity releases when upgrading operator.

## Implementation details (deep)
- **CRD app (`data-crds-clickhouse`):**
  - Chart: `sources/charts/foundation/common/raw-manifests`
  - Values: `sources/values/_shared/data/data-crds-clickhouse.yaml` with four `manifestFiles` pointing to the vendored CRDs above.
  - SSA: disabled (client-side apply). SyncOptions: `CreateNamespace`, `RespectIgnoreDifferences`.
- **CHI app (`data-clickhouse`):**
  - Chart: `sources/charts/third_party/altinity/clickhouse/clickhouse`
  - Values: `_shared` defines storage/resources/users/image; `dev` overlay tweaks storage/resources.
  - SyncOptions: `CreateNamespace`, `RespectIgnoreDifferences`, `SkipDryRunOnMissingResource` (no SSA).
  - Operator subchart: disabled (`operator.enabled: false`).
  - ExternalSecret: `clickhouse-auth` (from `data-clickhouse-secrets` / Vault).
- **Health script (ClickHouseInstallation):**
  - Location: `sources/values/common/argocd.yaml` (mirrored to `environments/dev/argocd/ops/argocd-cm.yaml`).
  - Logic: Suspended on `spec.stop/suspend`; Degraded on `status.error/errors`; Healthy on `status.status == "Completed"`; Progressing otherwise. OpenLibs enabled to use Lua stdlib safely.
- **Orphan policy:**
  - Project `ameide`: `warn: false`, ignore chi-* Service/StatefulSet/PDB/ConfigMap to acknowledge operator ownership.
- **Wave ordering:**
  - CRDs (wave ~210) → operator (wave ~220) → CHI (wave ~250) → dependents.

## Troubleshooting notes
- **CRD presence check:** `kubectl get crd | grep clickhouse` must show all four; absence of `clickhouseinstallations` causes CHI sync failures.
- **Argo panic “invalid memory address”:** the Argo CD application controller occasionally panics while diffing the `ClickHouseInstallation` resource, leaving `status.operationState.phase=Error` and `message="runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference"` even though the CHI is `Synced/Healthy`. This is a bug in Kubernetes apimachinery’s `strategicpatch` code path, not in ClickHouse or our manifests.
  - **Observed stack (v3.2.0, k8s 1.30):** controller logs show `Recovered from panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference` in `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/strategicpatch.handleMapDiff` → `CreateThreeWayMergePatch`, called from `github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v3/controller.getMergePatch/normalizeTargetResources`. The panic is in the diff/patch layer, not during actual CHI reconciliation.
  - **Argo / apimachinery versions:** both Argo CD `v3.2.0+66b2f30` and `v3.2.1` pin `k8s.io/apimachinery v0.34.0` in `go.mod`, and the 3.2.1 changelog does not mention a fix for this panic. As of 2025‑12‑01, upgrading from 3.2.0 to 3.2.1 does *not* eliminate the issue.
  - **Current mitigation:** scope `ServerSideApply=true` and `SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true` to the ClickHouse CRD/CHI Applications so normal syncs succeed and the CHI reaches `status.status=Completed`. When the only symptom is `operationState.phase=Error` with the panic message—but `status.sync.status=Synced` and `status.health.status=Healthy`—treat it as cosmetic noise and clear `status.operationState` once via `kubectl patch` if the UI needs to be clean.
  - **Tracking:** when Argo CD upgrades to a release that bumps `k8s.io/apimachinery` beyond `v0.34.0` and explicitly calls out a fix for the strategicpatch/CRD panic, re-test ClickHouse syncs and remove this workaround if the panic no longer reproduces.
- **Health stuck Unknown/Progressing:** ensure CM with Lua health is applied (argocd-cm) and OpenLibs enabled for `clickhouse.altinity.com_ClickHouseInstallation`.

## 420-temporal-cnpg-dev-registry-runbook.md

# 420 – Temporal CNPG creds + dev registry rollout (runbook and incident notes)

> ⚠️ **Legacy workflow:** References to the k3d dev registry (`k3d-ameide.localhost:5001`) describe the previous local-cluster model. With the remote-first pivot (backlog/435), dev builds push directly to ACR and run on AKS; keep these notes only for historical incident context.

## What we configured
- **Temporal DB ownership:** CNPG (`platform-postgres-clusters`) owns the `temporal` and `temporal_visibility` roles/secrets. The Temporal chart now uses `temporal`/`temporal_visibility` users via `temporal-db-credentials` and `temporal-visibility-db-credentials`. All Vault-authored ExternalSecrets for Temporal were removed; Vault is mirror-only if needed. See also `backlog/425-vendor-schema-ownership.md` for the general vendor schema pattern.
- **Schema hook matches upstream flow:** `data-migrations-temporal` runs the same steps as Temporal's `auto-setup.sh`. The Helm hook job:
  - Uses the GHCR-mirrored `ghcr.io/ameideio/mirror/temporalio-admin-tools` image (see `backlog/456-ghcr-mirror.md`) and runs the bundled `temporal-sql-tool` (version pinned via `values.schema.toolVersion`, kept in lockstep with the Temporal server image tag) instead of downloading it at runtime, matching Temporal's self-hosted guidance.
  - Always executes `setup-schema -v 0.0` for both databases (`postgresql/v12/temporal` and `/visibility`). This is idempotent and initializes `schema_version` if missing.
  - Immediately follows with `update-schema --schema-name ...` so the database is migrated to the latest manifest bundled with the chart. There is no manual `TargetVersion`; whatever is in `postgresql/v12/**/versioned` is what gets applied.
  - Uses only the CNPG-provided secrets (`temporal-db-env`, `temporal-visibility-db-env`) for connection info; no Flyway secrets or additional RBAC required.
  - Runs as a Helm hook (`pre-install,pre-upgrade`, weight -9) so it completes before the Temporal Deployment rolls out. Retrying the Argo app simply reruns the same setup/update sequence safely.
- **Env overlays aligned:** Local/staging/production overlays now also reference the CNPG app secrets (`temporal-db-credentials`, `temporal-visibility-db-credentials`) instead of the admin `postgres-ameide-auth` secret, so every environment uses the same application-scoped creds.
- **Dev registry wiring:** k3d local registry `k3d-ameide.localhost:5001/ameide` is the single endpoint for dev GitOps. Builds push via the host-published port `localhost:5001` (configurable via `AMEIDE_REGISTRY_PUSH_HOST`) to avoid DNS-to-container IP hangs.
- **Image naming:** Build script enforces hyphenated image tags (`agents-runtime`, `www-ameide`, `www-ameide-platform`, etc.) even if service directories use underscores. Filters accept either form.
- **Argo CD apps:** `data-temporal` and `data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap` are generated by the `ameide-dev` `ApplicationSet` (`gitops/ameide-gitops/environments/dev/argocd/apps/ameide.yaml`). The template now:
  - Defaults `syncPolicy.automated` to `prune: true`, `selfHeal: true` for apps that don’t opt out.
  - Applies a shared `retry` policy (`limit: 10` with exponential backoff up to 5m) so transient bootstrap failures (e.g., ExternalSecrets webhook, CNPG readiness) are retried automatically.
  - Uses RollingSync `rolloutPhase` ordering so `data-migrations-temporal` (migration) runs before `data-temporal` (runtime) and `data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap` (namespace job).
- **Temporal migrations sync policy:** The `data-migrations-temporal` Application now keeps `automated` sync but sets `prune: false` and `selfHeal: false`. The Helm hook still runs automatically on first install or whenever we intentionally sync/upgrade, but Argo no longer keeps re-creating the job after it deletes itself. This prevents repeated reruns of `setup-schema` that crash with duplicate key errors.

In dev, the **normal path** is now: open the DevContainer, let `tools/bootstrap/bootstrap-v2.sh` converge the cluster (see `backlog/429-devcontainer-bootstrap.md`), and rely on Argo’s automated sync + retry + RollingSync to bring Temporal apps healthy. The CLI `argocd app sync` steps below remain the manual recovery path when something is stuck (see also `backlog/423-temporal-argocd-recovery.md`).

## Issues we hit and fixes
- **Temporal CrashLoopBackOff (permission denied on `schema_version`):**
  - **Cause:** Temporal pods were using the generic `dbuser`, which lacked grants on `schema_version`; sometimes the schema table was absent after fresh cluster brings.
  - **Fix:** Switched chart values to the dedicated roles (`temporal`, `temporal_visibility`), removed Vault-driven secrets, and relied on CNPG-managed secrets. Ensured the Temporal schema hook (`data-migrations-temporal`) and namespace bootstrap run after sync (manual `argocd app sync data-migrations-temporal data-temporal{,-namespace-bootstrap}`).
- **Temporal CrashLoopBackOff (relation `schema_version` does not exist):**
  - **Cause:** Fresh cluster without Temporal schemas initialized (Temporal migrations/bootstrap not yet applied).
  - **Fix:** Sync `data-migrations-temporal`, then `data-temporal` and `data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap`; confirm `schema_version` exists via `psql` against CNPG. Post-sync, all Temporal deployments went Running.
- **Dev registry push hangs / missing images:**
  - **Cause:** Devcontainer resolving `k3d-ameide.localhost` to the registry container IP (no host port), and underscore image names diverging from GitOps values.
  - **Fix:** Build script now defaults push endpoint to `localhost:5001` while tagging `k3d-ameide.localhost:5001/ameide/<image>:dev`; enforces hyphenated tags; adds service filters; documents usage in README/backlog/415.
- **Temporal schema job reran endlessly (duplicate `namespace_metadata` PK):**
  - **Cause:** Because Argo self-healed deleted hook resources, the Helm hook job re-created itself after every sync. After the first successful `setup-schema`, the second rerun hit `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "namespace_metadata_pkey"` and exited before `update-schema` could bump the version, leaving Temporal stuck at `0.0`.
  - **Fix:** Disabled `prune`/`selfHeal` for the `data-migrations-temporal` Application so the hook only runs when we explicitly sync or bump the chart. Added the manual cleanup procedure below to clear any partially-initialized tables before the next intentional sync.

## Reproducible rollout (dev)
1) Pull repo + submodule: `git pull --recurse-submodules && git submodule update --init --recursive`.
2) Bootstrap dev cluster: `tools/bootstrap/bootstrap-v2.sh --config infra/environments/dev/bootstrap.yaml` (builds + pushes dev images to the local registry).
3) Port-forward and log into ArgoCD:
   ```
   kubectl -n argocd port-forward svc/argocd-server 8080:80 >/tmp/argocd-pf.log 2>&1 &
   ARGOCD_PASSWORD=$(kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d)
   argocd login localhost:8080 --username admin --password "$ARGOCD_PASSWORD" --insecure --grpc-web
   ```
4) If Temporal remains degraded after bootstrap, or you want to force a clean recovery, sync Temporal schema + apps and wait for health:
   ```
   argocd app sync data-migrations-temporal --grpc-web --server localhost:8080
   argocd app sync data-temporal --grpc-web --server localhost:8080
   argocd app sync data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap --grpc-web --server localhost:8080
   argocd app wait data-temporal data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap --health --timeout 180 --grpc-web --server localhost:8080
   ```
5) Verify pods: `kubectl get pods -n ameide | grep temporal` (all Running; namespace bootstrap Completed). DB check (optional): `psql -U temporal -d temporal -c "select * from schema_version;"` on a CNPG pod.

### Manual cleanup when `namespace_metadata_pkey` is duplicated

If `data-migrations-temporal-temporal-migrations` fails with:

```
duplicate key value violates unique constraint "namespace_metadata_pkey"
```

the schema setup phase re-ran after partially initializing the default namespace. Clean up and rerun the hook once:

1. Delete the stuck hook job so we start from a clean slate:
   ```
   kubectl -n ameide delete job data-migrations-temporal-temporal-migrations
   ```
2. Remove the duplicate namespace row from CNPG (pick the primary pod for `platform-postgres-clusters`):
   ```
   CNPG=$(kubectl -n ameide get pods -l cnpg.io/cluster=platform-postgres-clusters,role=primary -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
   kubectl -n ameide exec -it "${CNPG}" -- psql -U temporal -d temporal -c \
     "delete from namespace_metadata where namespace_id='namespace|default';"
   ```
3. Trigger the hook exactly once:
   ```
   argocd app sync data-migrations-temporal --grpc-web --server localhost:8080
   ```
   Wait for the hook pod to finish and confirm `temporal-sql-tool version` now matches the chart’s expected version (currently `1.18`).
4. Re-sync the runtime and namespace bootstrap apps as in step 4 above.

## Follow-ups / hardening
- Auto-sync + retry for `data-temporal*` in dev is now configured via the shared ApplicationSet template. Manual `argocd app sync`/`app wait` is reserved for explicit recovery (especially after schema or CNPG incidents).
- Add a guardrail smoke to fail fast if `schema_version` is missing or if Temporal roles lack table privileges (e.g., simple readiness check pod).
- Keep dev Tilt registry config separate; do not point Tilt at `k3d-ameide.localhost` unless intentionally sharing artifacts with Argo.

For related design and runbooks, see:

- `backlog/425-vendor-schema-ownership.md` – vendor vs Flyway schema ownership (Temporal pattern).
- `backlog/423-temporal-argocd-recovery.md` – detailed recovery flows when Temporal or namespace bootstrap fail in Argo.
- `backlog/429-devcontainer-bootstrap.md` – how the DevContainer + `bootstrap-v2.sh` orchestrate k3d, Argo, and GitOps end-to-end.
- `backlog/456-ghcr-mirror.md` – GHCR mirroring for Docker Hub rate limiting (Temporal uses GHCR mirrors for server, admin-tools, and UI images).

## 421-argocd-strimzi-kafkanodepool-health.md

# 421 – Argo CD + Strimzi KafkaNodePool health alignment

**Status:** Documented / fixed / refined  
**Scope:** `data-kafka-cluster` Application (Strimzi Kafka) under Argo CD RollingSync  
**Date:** 2025-12-01

## Configuration snapshot
- **Argo version:** v3.2.0 (OpenLibs enabled; Lua health scripts in `sources/values/common/argocd.yaml` → rendered into `argocd-cm`).  
- **RollingSync steps (ApplicationSet `ameide-dev`):**
  - Wave 210: `data-crds-strimzi` (`environments/dev/components/data/crds/strimzi/component.yaml`, raw-manifests chart with vendored Strimzi 0.48.0 CRDs `files/strimzi/040-049`, plus `ignoreDifferences` on `.spec.versions` for those 10 CRDs to mute API-server schema/defaulting noise).
  - Wave 220: `foundation-strimzi-operator` (`environments/dev/components/foundation/operators/strimzi/component.yaml`, Strimzi operator 0.48.0, CRDs skipped).
  - Wave 250: `data-kafka-cluster` (`environments/dev/components/data/core/kafka-cluster/component.yaml`, operators-config/kafka_cluster chart creating `Kafka` + `KafkaNodePool` in ns `ameide`).
- **Chart/values:** `sources/charts/foundation/operators-config/kafka_cluster` with `_shared` values (`namespace: ameide`, single nodepool replica, Kafka 4.0.0, KRaft).
- **Health customizations (before fix):**
  - `kafka.strimzi.io/Kafka`: Ready-based Lua (kept).
  - `kafka.strimzi.io/KafkaNodePool`: custom Lua that required `status.conditions[type=Ready]` (now removed).
  - `kafka.strimzi.io/KafkaTopic`: Ready-based Lua (kept).
- **Health customizations (after refinements):**
  - `kafka.strimzi.io/Kafka`: still gates **only** on `status.conditions[type=Ready]` with `observedGeneration >= metadata.generation`, but now also surfaces any `Warning` conditions in the message (without changing status) and avoids `string.*` / `table.concat` by using a small local `join()` helper.
  - `kafka.strimzi.io/KafkaTopic`: same pattern as Kafka (Ready-based gating, `observedGeneration` check, warnings included in the message only).
  - `kafka.strimzi.io/KafkaNodePool`: **no** health override – node pools no longer gate Argo health; Kafka remains the authoritative readiness signal.
- **Sync options:** `CreateNamespace`, `RespectIgnoreDifferences`, `SkipDryRunOnMissingResource` on data-kafka-cluster.

## Issues observed
1) **App stuck Progressing:** `data-kafka-cluster` never turned Healthy because the custom KafkaNodePool health script waited for `conditions[type=Ready]`. Strimzi 0.48.0 does not emit a Ready condition for KafkaNodePool (by design; readiness is reported on the Kafka CR). NodePool `status.conditions` was empty, so health stayed Progressing.
2) **Orphan warnings:** Application reported 11 orphaned Secrets (envoy, ghcr pull, tls). This is existing noise unrelated to Kafka health; not addressed in this fix.
3) **Controller reload needed:** After removing the health key from `argocd-cm`, the application controller required a restart to pick up the new Lua set; otherwise, stale health logic persisted.

## Remediations applied
- **Removed KafkaNodePool health override** to stop gating on a nonexistent Ready condition. Path: `sources/values/common/argocd.yaml` → deleted `resource.customizations.health.kafka.strimzi.io_KafkaNodePool`. Committed in gitops repo `ameide-gitops` main at `a00036a`.
- **Refined Kafka/KafkaTopic health scripts** to (a) gate strictly on Ready with `observedGeneration` checks, (b) include Warning conditions in the health message, and (c) avoid Lua stdlib dependencies (`string.*`, `table.concat`). Paths: `sources/values/common/argocd.yaml` and `environments/dev/argocd/ops/argocd-cm.yaml`. Committed in gitops repo at `06d22eb` / `929cb57`.
- **Propagated to cluster:** Patched `argocd-cm` to pick up the new scripts and restarted `argocd-application-controller` StatefulSet. Performed hard refreshes on `data-kafka-cluster` and related apps to recalc health.
- **Aligned Strimzi CRDs with vendored 0.48.0 definitions** by replacing the live `kafkas.kafka.strimzi.io` CRD (and siblings) with the manifests from `files/strimzi/040-049` using `kubectl replace` (preferred over `apply` for large CRDs), so the API-server state matches Git aside from canonicalization.
- **Scoped CRD diff noise** by adding `ignoreDifferences` entries for the Strimzi CRDs in `environments/dev/components/data/crds/strimzi/component.yaml`, targeting `.spec.versions`. This keeps Argo from reporting perpetual OutOfSync on CRDs caused by API-server rewriting of version blocks, while still enforcing presence and non-CRD fields via the app and the upgrade runbook.
- **Result:** `data-kafka-cluster` now Healthy; Kafka CR Healthy and gates the wave; KafkaNodePool no longer evaluated for health. `data-crds-strimzi` converges to Synced/Healthy once the CRD schemas are aligned and the ignore rules are in place. Orphan warnings remain (unchanged).

## Operational checklist (repeatable)
1. **Config change:** Ensure `sources/values/common/argocd.yaml` no longer defines `resource.customizations.health.kafka.strimzi.io_KafkaNodePool`. Deploy Argo CD so `argocd-cm` matches.
2. **Reload controller:** `kubectl -n argocd rollout restart sts argocd-application-controller` and wait for readiness.
3. **Refresh app:** Hard refresh `data-kafka-cluster` (annotation `argocd.argoproj.io/refresh: hard` or CLI `argocd app get` followed by refresh) to clear cached health.
4. **Verify:** `kubectl get app data-kafka-cluster -n argocd -o jsonpath='{.status.health.status}'` should read `Healthy`; `argocd app resources data-kafka-cluster` shows Kafka/KafkaNodePool Synced and non-orphaned. Orphaned Secrets remain unless separately ignored.

## Troubleshooting notes
- If health stays Progressing after removal, confirm the CM no longer contains the key: `kubectl -n argocd get cm argocd-cm -o json | jq -r '.data | keys[]' | grep KafkaNodePool` (should return nothing). Then restart the controller and hard refresh the app.
- Kafka cluster readiness is tracked on the `Kafka` CR (`status.conditions[type=Ready]==True`); do not add Ready-based checks to KafkaNodePool—Strimzi does not publish them.
- Orphan warnings can be silenced via project-level ignores if desired; they are unrelated to Strimzi health.

## Current state
- `data-kafka-cluster`: Synced/Healthy.  
- `foundation-strimzi-operator`: Synced/Healthy.  
- `data-crds-strimzi`: Synced/Healthy (Strimzi CRDs match vendored 0.48.0; Argo ignores server-side changes under `.spec.versions` for the Strimzi CRDs via targeted `ignoreDifferences`).  
- Orphan warnings: still present (11 Secrets); unchanged by this work.

## Additional fixes (2025-12-05)

### Strimzi operator namespace watching
**Problem:** Strimzi operator was only watching `strimzi-system` namespace (using `metadata.namespace` in `STRIMZI_NAMESPACE` env var), so Kafka CRs in app namespaces like `ameide-dev` were never reconciled.

**Fix:** Updated `sources/values/_shared/cluster/strimzi-operator.yaml`:
```yaml
# Watch ALL namespaces for Kafka CRs
watchAnyNamespace: true
```
This sets `STRIMZI_NAMESPACE: "*"` in the operator deployment.

**Commit:** `83b2674` – fix(strimzi): enable watchAnyNamespace for all Kafka CRs

**Note:** ArgoCD may show server-side diff conflict when transitioning from `valueFrom.fieldRef` to `value: "*"`. If sync fails, manually apply via:
```bash
helm template foundation-strimzi-operator sources/charts/cluster/strimzi-operator \
  -f sources/values/_shared/cluster/strimzi-operator.yaml \
  -n strimzi-system | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Kafka cluster tolerations and nodeAffinity
**Problem:** Kafka pods stayed Pending with `0/15 nodes are available: 5 node(s) had untolerated taint {ameide.io/environment: dev}`. The chart template didn't propagate tolerations from values.

**Fix:** Modified `sources/charts/foundation/operators-config/kafka_cluster/templates/kafka.yaml`:
- Added `{{- with .Values.kafka.template }}` block to KafkaNodePool spec
- Added `{{- with .Values.entityOperator.template }}` block to Kafka CR

Environment-specific values (e.g., `sources/values/dev/data/data-kafka-cluster.yaml`) now correctly inject:
```yaml
kafka:
  template:
    pod:
      tolerations:
        - key: "ameide.io/environment"
          value: "dev"
          effect: "NoSchedule"
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
              - matchExpressions:
                  - key: ameide.io/pool
                    operator: In
                    values:
                      - dev
```

**Commit:** `aa5a29c` – fix(kafka): add template support for tolerations and nodeAffinity

**Recovery:** If Kafka pods remain Pending after sync, delete the StrimziPodSet to force recreation:
```bash
kubectl delete strimzipodset -n ameide-dev kafka-pool
```

## Follow-ups (optional)
- Add a replicas-based KafkaNodePool health script only if needed (check `status.replicas` vs `spec.replicas`), but keep Kafka Ready as the authoritative signal.
- Keep Strimzi CRDs in sync with the operator version by updating `files/strimzi/040-049` from the corresponding tag in the Strimzi repo and re-running `kubectl replace` plus an Argo sync on `data-crds-strimzi` during each upgrade.
- Consider project-level orphan ignores for the repeating Secrets if they are expected operator outputs.
- Document the vendor stance: KafkaNodePool has status but no Ready condition; Kafka CR carries the Ready condition. Keep Argo customizations aligned with that contract when upgrading Strimzi.

## 422-plausible-argocd-alignment.md

# 422: Plausible ArgoCD alignment (dev)

## What Plausible now does

- **External DBs only.** `DATABASE_URL` points to the CNPG Postgres service (`platform-postgres-clusters-rw.ameide.svc:5432/plausible`) using the CNPG-owned secret `plausible-db-credentials` (username/password keys). `CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE_URL` / `_READ` point to the Altinity ClickHouse HTTP endpoint on 8123 with creds from `clickhouse-auth` (user `plausible`).
- **Vendor init flow enabled.** Deployment now ships an initContainer that runs `/entrypoint.sh db createdb && /entrypoint.sh db migrate` before `run`. This creates/updates both Postgres and ClickHouse schema exactly as the Plausible image expects.
- **Secrets aligned with CNPG ownership.** The Deployment no longer consumes the cluster admin secret `postgres-ameide-auth`; it uses the per-app CNPG secret (`plausible-db-credentials`), satisfying backlog/412 (CNPG owns Postgres creds).
- **Flyway opt-out.** Plausible is removed from the Flyway image and db-migrations Job; schema creation/migrations are solely handled by the Plausible entrypoint. Remaining db-migrations values (local/staging/production) no longer list `plausible-db-credentials`, so Flyway stops mounting Plausible creds entirely.

## Issues encountered

1) **Schema ownership conflict**
   - Flyway tried to own Plausible schema via `plausible-db-credentials`, while the runtime used the shared admin secret. ClickHouse schema was unmanaged because Plausible entrypoint migrations were never run.
   - Fix: Runtime now uses `plausible-db-credentials` and an initContainer to run Plausible’s entrypoint migrations; Flyway no longer touches Plausible.

2) **ArgoCD deletion loop on apps-plausible**
   - The Application was stuck deleting (seed Job finalizer), leaving Deployment missing.
   - Fix: Cleared finalizers, let the ApplicationSet recreate; now Synced/Healthy with the initContainer in place.

## How to verify (dev)

- `argocd app get argocd/apps-plausible` should show Synced/Healthy and the Deployment spec containing `initContainers: plausible-db-init` with the entrypoint command.
- Pods should start with the init phase completing and main container running `run`; ClickHouse/Postgres should have the Plausible tables post-start.
- No Plausible-related Flyway locations or secrets remain in `data-db-migrations` values or Job template.

## Guardrails / follow-ups

- Keep Plausible schema exclusively managed by Plausible entrypoint migrations; do not reintroduce it into Flyway.
- Mirror the initContainer enablement and CNPG secret wiring in any non-dev overlays.
- Monitor first rollout after image bumps to ensure `/entrypoint.sh db migrate` succeeds against ClickHouse/Postgres.***

## 423-temporal-argocd-recovery.md

# 423: Temporal ArgoCD recovery (dev)

## Context

- Temporal runs via the upstream Helm chart (`sources/charts/third_party/temporal/temporal/0.70.0`) with Postgres for default and visibility stores.
- Schema management is handled by the dedicated `data-migrations-temporal` Helm hook (runs `temporal-sql-tool`), which owns Temporal schema versions. Namespace bootstrap is a separate job (`data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap`).
- Both the migrations job and the runtime/namespace apps are generated by the `ameide-dev` `ApplicationSet` (`gitops/ameide-gitops/environments/dev/argocd/apps/ameide.yaml`), which:
  - Ensures `data-migrations-temporal` (rolloutPhase 265) runs before the Temporal runtime and namespace bootstrap apps (rolloutPhases 450/455).
  - Applies a shared `retry` policy (`limit: 10` with exponential backoff) and default `syncPolicy.automated.prune/selfHeal` for apps that don’t override it.
  - Uses RollingSync to keep Temporal dependencies ordered correctly.

See also:

- `backlog/425-vendor-schema-ownership.md` – vendor‑owned schema pattern (Temporal, CNPG).
- `backlog/420-temporal-cnpg-dev-registry-runbook.md` – broader Temporal + CNPG + dev registry story.
- `backlog/429-devcontainer-bootstrap.md` – how DevContainer bootstrap drives Argo/Temporal in dev.
- `backlog/456-ghcr-mirror.md` – GHCR mirroring for Docker Hub rate limiting; Temporal images use GHCR mirrors.

## Issues encountered

1) **Schema missing → CrashLoop**
   - Temporal frontends/matching/history/worker crashed with `schema_version` relation missing.
   - Cause: Temporal schema not applied (or partially applied), so services failed their compatibility check.

2) **Namespace bootstrap failing**
   - `data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap` Job looped with connection refused to Temporal gRPC (7233).
   - Cause: Temporal services were down due to missing schema; bootstrap couldn’t reach the endpoint.

## Fixes applied (generic recipe)

Even with `data-migrations-temporal` owning the schema and automated sync/retry enabled, you can still hit the schema-missing crash on a fresh dev cluster (e.g., if migrations ran before CNPG was fully ready, or against a previous cluster). The recovery recipe is:

- **Run Temporal migrations hook** (`data-migrations-temporal` Application) to apply Temporal schema (default + visibility) via `temporal-sql-tool`. Output should show idempotent “duplicate update” warnings if the schema is already at the desired version.
- **Restart Temporal pods** (or let Argo/Deployment restart them) so they recheck the now‑initialized schema; all Temporal deployments should converge to Running.
- **Resync namespace bootstrap** (`data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap`) once Temporal is up; the Job should complete and the app should go Healthy.
- **Argo state:** `data-temporal` and `data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap` should both be Synced/Healthy with no lingering schema errors once the above is complete.

## Verification steps (dev)

- `argocd app get argocd/data-temporal` → Health: Healthy; deployments Running.
- `argocd app get argocd/data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap` → Health: Healthy; Job succeeded.
- Temporal pods in `ameide` namespace all Running; no CrashLoopBackOff.
- Database: `schema_version` exists and reflects latest Temporal version (as reported by `temporal-sql-tool`).

## Recovery Incident: 2025-12-03

### Root Cause Analysis

The Temporal migration failed due to multiple compounding issues:

1. **PostgreSQL 15+ Schema Ownership Change**: PostgreSQL 15+ no longer grants world-writable access to the `public` schema by default. The `temporal` user could not create tables in the `public` schema of its own database because CNPG creates databases with `dbuser` as the owner.

2. **Partial Migration State**: The `temporal-sql-tool` ran `setup-schema` which created tables and set `schema_version` to `0.0`, but then `update-schema` failed on an INSERT statement (`INSERT INTO namespace_metadata`) because:
   - The job has `backoffLimit: 3`, causing retries
   - First pod created tables successfully
   - Retry pods hit "duplicate key" errors on the INSERT
   - The tool ignores "table already exists" but NOT "duplicate key" errors

3. **ArgoCD Hook State**: The migration job got stuck in "Terminating" state due to finalizers, blocking subsequent syncs.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. CNPG Database CRD with Schema Ownership (Declarative)

Modified the postgres_clusters Helm chart to support the `schemas` field in the CNPG Database CRD:

**File**: `sources/charts/foundation/operators-config/postgres_clusters/templates/databases.yaml`
```yaml
{{- if $db.schemas }}
  schemas:
{{ toYaml $db.schemas | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
```

**File**: `sources/values/_shared/data/platform-postgres-clusters.yaml`
```yaml
databases:
  - name: temporal
    owner: temporal
    schemas:
      - name: public
        owner: temporal
  - name: temporal-visibility
    dbName: temporal_visibility
    owner: temporal_visibility
    schemas:
      - name: public
        owner: temporal_visibility
  # ... similar for all other databases
```

This ensures each database's `public` schema is owned by the database owner, fixing the PostgreSQL 15+ permission issue.

#### 2. Migration Job Idempotency (Added but Incomplete)

Added version checking to the migration job to skip if schema is already at target version:

**File**: `sources/charts/platform-layers/temporal-migrations/templates/job.yaml`
- Added `version_gte()` function to compare version strings
- Calls `temporal-sql-tool describe-schema` before running migrations
- Skips migration if current version >= target version

**File**: `sources/values/_shared/data/data-migrations-temporal.yaml`
```yaml
databases:
  default:
    targetVersion: "1.18"
  visibility:
    targetVersion: "1.9"
```

**Note**: This idempotency check helps for future runs but doesn't handle partial migration states where tables exist but version is 0.0.

#### 3. Manual Recovery of Partial State

When migration failed mid-way (tables created, version=0.0, namespace_metadata row inserted):

```bash
# Delete the conflicting row that caused duplicate key errors
kubectl exec -n ameide data-temporal-admintools-... -- \
  env PGPASSWORD=dbpassword psql \
  -h platform-postgres-clusters-rw.ameide.svc.cluster.local \
  -U temporal -d temporal \
  -c "DELETE FROM namespace_metadata WHERE partition_id = 54321;"

# Delete stuck job and clear ArgoCD operation state
kubectl delete job data-migrations-temporal-temporal-migrations -n ameide --force --grace-period=0
kubectl patch application data-migrations-temporal -n argocd --type=merge -p '{"operation": null}'

# Trigger fresh sync
kubectl annotate application data-migrations-temporal -n argocd argocd.argoproj.io/refresh=hard --overwrite
kubectl patch application data-migrations-temporal -n argocd --type=merge -p '{"operation": {"initiatedBy": {"username": "admin"}, "sync": {"prune": true}}}'
```

### Final State

After recovery:
- `temporal` database: schema version **1.18**
- `temporal_visibility` database: schema version **1.9**
- All Temporal pods: **Running**
- ArgoCD apps: `data-migrations-temporal`, `data-temporal`, `data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap` all **Synced/Healthy**

### Automation Follow-up: Guaranteed Re-runs + Setup Guardrail (2025-12-04)

To avoid manual intervention the next time the hook needs to run:

1. **Hook auto-trigger** – The `data-migrations-temporal` Helm chart now derives the `force-trigger` annotation automatically from the chart version + target schema versions. Any bump to either value causes ArgoCD to see a diff and rerun the pre-install hook; no more timestamp edits in `sources/values/_shared/data/data-migrations-temporal.yaml`.
2. **Skip duplicate `setup-schema`** – The hook template now calls `setup-schema` only if `describe-schema` fails. If the schema already exists (even if the version is stuck at `0.0`), the job jumps straight to `update-schema`, which prevents the duplicate-key crash that previously required manual clean-up.

> **Reminder:** The namespace bootstrap job (`data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap`) still depends on Temporal’s gRPC endpoint. Run the migrations first, ensure the Temporal deployments are healthy, and only then re-sync the namespace bootstrap Application.

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `sources/charts/foundation/operators-config/postgres_clusters/templates/databases.yaml` | Added `schemas` field support |
| `sources/charts/foundation/operators-config/postgres_clusters/values.yaml` | Added schemas to all database definitions |
| `sources/values/_shared/data/platform-postgres-clusters.yaml` | Added schemas with correct owners for all databases |
| `sources/charts/platform-layers/temporal-migrations/templates/job.yaml` | Added version checking for idempotency |
| `sources/charts/platform-layers/temporal-migrations/values.yaml` | Added `targetVersion` to database configs |
| `sources/values/_shared/data/data-migrations-temporal.yaml` | Added `targetVersion` for default (1.18) and visibility (1.9) |

### Known Limitations

1. **temporal-sql-tool limitations**: The tool's `update-schema` command doesn't treat "duplicate key" INSERT errors as ignorable (unlike "table already exists"). This can cause failures on retry if the first attempt partially succeeded.

2. **Partial state recovery**: If a migration fails mid-way, manual intervention may be needed to either:
   - Delete conflicting rows and re-run
   - Drop the database entirely and re-run (destructive)

3. **Hook triggering**: ArgoCD hooks only run when there are actual resource changes. Adding a `force-trigger` annotation to the job values can help trigger re-runs when needed.

## Guardrails / follow-ups

- Keep Temporal schema ownership in the dedicated Temporal migrations job; rerun `data-migrations-temporal` before Temporal upgrades to ensure compatibility (see `backlog/425-vendor-schema-ownership.md`).
- If Temporal pods crash with schema errors, rerun `data-migrations-temporal`, then restart pods or allow Argo to resync, then rerun namespace bootstrap as needed.
- Monitor first rollout after Temporal version bumps for schema compatibility checks; document any vendor‑specific caveats in this backlog and cross‑link from `backlog/420-temporal-cnpg-dev-registry-runbook.md` and `backlog/429-devcontainer-bootstrap.md`.
- **PostgreSQL 15+ compatibility**: Always ensure CNPG Database CRDs include `schemas` with correct ownership for the database owner.
- **Partial migration recovery**: If migration job fails with "duplicate key" errors, check the database state and delete conflicting rows before re-running.

## Recovery Incident: 2025-12-05

### Root Cause Analysis

This incident combined password mismatch with the existing partial migration state issues:

1. **Password Mismatch Between CNPG and Temporal Services**: The CNPG credential consolidation created TWO separate entries that generated DIFFERENT passwords:
   - `temporal-db-env` (used by Temporal services) - one random password
   - `temporal-db-credentials` (used by CNPG role) - different random password

   Result: Temporal services couldn't authenticate to Postgres because CNPG set the role password from `temporal-db-credentials`, but services connected using `temporal-db-env`.

2. **Migration Job Missing Tolerations**: The `temporal-migrations` Helm chart didn't support `nodeSelector`/`tolerations`, causing pods to remain Pending on dev nodes with `ameide.io/environment: dev` taint.

3. **Partial Migration State** (same as 2025-12-03): Multiple job retries caused duplicate key errors on `INSERT INTO namespace_metadata`.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Consolidated Temporal Credentials (commit `8d4a519`)

Removed duplicate credential entries and updated CNPG to use the same secret as Temporal services:

**File**: `sources/values/_shared/data/platform-postgres-clusters.yaml`
```yaml
# Before: CNPG and Temporal used different secrets
managed:
  roles:
    - name: temporal
      passwordSecret:
        name: temporal-db-credentials  # Different password!

# After: CNPG uses same secret as Temporal
managed:
  roles:
    - name: temporal
      passwordSecret:
        name: temporal-db-env  # Same password as Temporal services
    - name: temporal_visibility
      passwordSecret:
        name: temporal-visibility-db-env
```

Also removed duplicate entries `temporal-password` and `temporal-visibility-password` from `credentials.appUsers`.

#### 2. Updated Temporal Helm Values (commit `6adcdb6`)

Changed secret references in Temporal chart to use the consolidated `-db-env` secrets:

**File**: `sources/values/_shared/data/data-temporal.yaml`
```yaml
server:
  config:
    persistence:
      default:
        sql:
          existingSecret: temporal-db-env  # was: temporal-db-credentials
      visibility:
        sql:
          existingSecret: temporal-visibility-db-env  # was: temporal-visibility-db-credentials
```

#### 3. Added Tolerations to Migration Job (commit `2e9acb0`)

**File**: `sources/charts/platform-layers/temporal-migrations/templates/job.yaml`
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      {{- with .Values.nodeSelector }}
      nodeSelector:
        {{- toYaml . | nindent 8 }}
      {{- end }}
      {{- with .Values.tolerations }}
      tolerations:
        {{- toYaml . | nindent 8 }}
      {{- end }}
```

This allows the migration job to schedule on environment-specific nodes using tolerations from `globals.yaml`.

### Recovery Steps (for partial state)

When migration failed mid-way with databases in partial state:

```bash
# 1. Drop and recreate databases cleanly
kubectl exec -n ameide-dev postgres-ameide-1 -- psql -U postgres -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS temporal;"
kubectl exec -n ameide-dev postgres-ameide-1 -- psql -U postgres -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS temporal_visibility;"

# 2. Delete CNPG Database CRDs to trigger recreation
kubectl delete database postgres-ameide-temporal postgres-ameide-temporal-visibility -n ameide-dev

# 3. Sync postgres-clusters to recreate databases
kubectl annotate application dev-platform-postgres-clusters -n argocd argocd.argoproj.io/refresh=hard --overwrite
kubectl patch application dev-platform-postgres-clusters -n argocd --type=merge \
  -p '{"operation": {"initiatedBy": {"username": "admin"}, "sync": {"prune": true}}}'

# 4. Wait for databases to be created, then trigger migration
kubectl delete application dev-data-migrations-temporal -n argocd --wait=false
# ApplicationSet will recreate it and trigger hooks

# 5. After migration completes, refresh Temporal app
kubectl annotate application dev-data-temporal -n argocd argocd.argoproj.io/refresh=hard --overwrite
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n ameide-dev -l app.kubernetes.io/name=temporal
```

### Environment Isolation

The credential consolidation preserves per-environment password isolation:

1. **Helm lookup is namespace-scoped**: `lookup "v1" "Secret" $namespace $secretName` only finds secrets in the target namespace
2. **Each environment gets unique passwords**: Dev/staging/prod have separate secrets generated in their respective ArgoCD syncs
3. **No cross-env secret sharing**: The consolidation only affects secrets **within** each environment

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `sources/values/_shared/data/platform-postgres-clusters.yaml` | Removed duplicate temporal-password entries; updated CNPG managed.roles to use `-db-env` secrets |
| `sources/values/_shared/data/data-temporal.yaml` | Updated existingSecret references to use `-db-env` secrets |
| `sources/charts/platform-layers/temporal-migrations/templates/job.yaml` | Added nodeSelector and tolerations support |
| `sources/charts/platform-layers/temporal-namespace-bootstrap/templates/namespace-bootstrap-job.yaml` | Added nodeSelector and tolerations support (commit `7270a0b`) |

### Verification

```bash
# Passwords match within environment (CNPG role and Temporal service use same)
kubectl get secret temporal-db-env -n ameide-dev -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d

# Schema versions after successful migration
kubectl exec -n ameide-dev postgres-ameide-1 -- psql -U postgres -d temporal -c "SELECT curr_version FROM schema_version;"
# Should show: 1.18

kubectl exec -n ameide-dev postgres-ameide-1 -- psql -U postgres -d temporal_visibility -c "SELECT curr_version FROM schema_version;"
# Should show: 1.9

# Temporal pods healthy
kubectl get pods -n ameide-dev -l app.kubernetes.io/name=temporal
```

### Final State

Recovery completed successfully:
- `temporal` database: schema version **1.18**
- `temporal_visibility` database: schema version **1.9**
- All 10 Temporal pods: **Running**
- ArgoCD apps: `dev-data-migrations-temporal`, `dev-data-temporal`, `dev-data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap` all **Synced/Healthy**

## Recovery Incident: 2025-12-05 (GHCR Mirror Alignment)

### Root Cause Analysis

This incident occurred during GHCR mirror alignment (backlog/456-ghcr-mirror.md):

1. **Busybox init container missing `nc` command**: The Temporal init container was using `cgr.dev/chainguard/busybox` which doesn't include the `nc` (netcat) command needed for the wait-for-backends script.

2. **Migration job using Docker Hub image**: The `temporal-migrations` job was using `temporalio/admin-tools` from Docker Hub, which was rate-limited.

3. **Partial migration state**: Previous failed migration attempts left the databases in partial state with `schema_version` at 0.0 and duplicate key conflicts in `namespace_metadata`.

4. **Old pods stuck in Init:0/1**: Old ReplicaSets had pods stuck waiting on the old busybox image.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. GHCR Busybox Mirror (commit in session)

Changed Temporal init container to use GHCR mirror with netcat support:

**File**: `sources/values/_shared/data/data-temporal.yaml`
```yaml
additionalInitContainers:
  - name: wait-for-backends
    # Using GHCR mirror to avoid Docker Hub rate limits
    image: ghcr.io/ameideio/mirror/busybox:1.36.1
```

#### 2. GHCR Migration Job Image (commit in session)

**File**: `sources/values/_shared/data/data-migrations-temporal.yaml`
```yaml
image:
  repository: ghcr.io/ameideio/mirror/temporalio-admin-tools
  tag: "1.29.1-tctl-1.18.4-cli-1.5.0"
imagePullSecrets:
  - ghcr-pull
```

### Recovery Steps

```bash
# 1. Delete conflicting namespace_metadata row
kubectl exec -n ameide-dev data-temporal-admintools-... -- \
  env PGPASSWORD=... psql -h platform-postgres-clusters-rw.ameide-dev.svc.cluster.local \
  -U temporal -d temporal -c "DELETE FROM namespace_metadata WHERE partition_id = 54321;"

# 2. Delete old stuck pods (Init:0/1 from old ReplicaSets)
kubectl delete pod -n ameide-dev <old-init-stuck-pods> --force --grace-period=0

# 3. Restart affected Temporal deployments
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n ameide-dev \
  data-temporal-frontend data-temporal-matching data-temporal-worker

# 4. Delete failed namespace-bootstrap job and re-sync
kubectl delete job data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap-temporal-namespace-bootstrap \
  -n ameide-dev --force --grace-period=0
kubectl annotate application dev-data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap -n argocd \
  argocd.argoproj.io/refresh=hard --overwrite
kubectl patch application dev-data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap -n argocd \
  --type merge -p '{"operation":{"initiatedBy":{"username":"admin"},"sync":{"prune":true}}}'
```

### Final State

Recovery completed successfully:
- `temporal` database: schema version **1.18**
- `temporal_visibility` database: schema version **1.9**
- All 10 Temporal pods: **Running**
- ArgoCD apps: `dev-data-migrations-temporal`, `dev-data-temporal`, `dev-data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap` all **Synced/Healthy**

## 424-tilt-www-ameide-separate-release.md

﻿# 424 – Tilt-only releases (www + platform) to avoid Argo/Tilt tug-of-war

**Status:** Implemented  
**Intent:** Fully separate Tilt’s inner-loop releases from Argo’s GitOps baselines. Tilt owns `*-tilt` releases (distinct names/hosts/secrets); Argo owns `apps-*`. No shared ownership, no adoption/pause/orphan dance.

---

## Why we changed this
- **Symptom:** Tilt applies failed with image/ownership drift because Argo auto-sync kept restoring the GitOps image and metadata on shared releases.
- **Root causes:** ApplicationSet reasserts `syncPolicy.automated`; adoption/pause/guardrails were fragile and created ownership churn.
- **Solution:** Isolation. Give Tilt its own release names, hosts, and (when needed) secrets, and stop touching Argo-managed resources.

---

## Final architecture (www + platform)
- **Baseline (Argo):** `apps-www-ameide`, `apps-www-ameide-platform` remain Argo-owned with GitOps images/tags and existing secrets/ExternalSecrets.
- **Tilt-only:** `apps-www-ameide-tilt`, `apps-www-ameide-platform-tilt` are Helm’d by Tilt with Tilt image tags and distinct names/hosts.
- **Ownership:** Argo is unaware of `*-tilt`; Tilt never deploys or adopts baseline releases.
- **Keycloak (shared instance):** Remains Argo-owned and shared across dev + Tilt. Both baseline and Tilt use the same realm/clients; Tilt reuses Argo auth secrets and continues to use the canonical issuer `https://auth.dev.ameide.io/realms/ameide`, while Envoy routes both `auth.dev.ameide.io` and `auth.local.ameide.io` to the same Keycloak service.

---

## What we changed (code/config)
### Tiltfile
- Only `*-tilt` Helm releases are defined for web/apps; integration deps updated to `*-tilt`.
- Removed Argo pause, guard, adoption, and orphan preflight; Helm apply helper now runs a plain `helm upgrade --install`.
- SDK deps scoped per service (TS/Go/Py) instead of a blanket guardrail.

### Values and routing
- Added tilt values for all apps: `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/values/dev/apps/apps-*-tilt.yaml` with `nameOverride/fullnameOverride=<service>-tilt`, Tilt registries/tags.
- Disabled ExternalSecrets in all tilt values; services reuse Argo-managed secrets via `existingSecret` (e.g., `www-ameide-auth`, `www-ameide-platform-auth`, `inference-db-credentials`).
- Hosts/HTTPRoutes:
  - `www.local.ameide.io` → HTTPRoute in `apps-www-ameide-tilt` (gateway `ameide`, section `https-local`).
  - `platform.local.ameide.io` → HTTPRoute in `apps-www-ameide-platform-tilt` (gateway `ameide`, section `https-local`).
  - Other tilt services stay internal unless hosts are added to their tilt values.
  - Keycloak in dev: `auth.dev.ameide.io` (canonical issuer) and `auth.local.ameide.io` (local alias) both route via Envoy to the shared Keycloak instance; apps in dev and Tilt are configured to use the `auth.dev.ameide.io` issuer.
- Redis auth: tilt platform values now wire `redis.passwordSecret` (`redis-auth/password`) to avoid NOAUTH and keep parity with Argo releases. No inline secrets introduced.

### DNS / host resolution
- With the remote-first architecture, developers hit the public `*.ameide.io` domains directly (Envoy in AKS serves both `dev` and `local` aliases), so the old dnsmasq helper was removed. Telepresence handles routing cluster traffic back to the local process without requiring host-level resolver tweaks.

---

## How to use (developer loop)
1) Run `tilt up -- --only=apps-www-ameide-tilt,apps-www-ameide-platform-tilt` (or include other `*-tilt` services you need).  
2) Browse:
   - Argo baseline: `https://www.dev.ameide.io`
   - Tilt web: `https://www.local.ameide.io`
   - Tilt platform: `https://platform.local.ameide.io`
3) Auth/Keycloak secrets are reused; no extra secret provisioning for tilt releases.
4) Argo will keep reconciling baseline releases, but Tilt no longer touches them.

---

## Notes and limitations
- Tilt releases do not create or adopt ExternalSecrets; they rely on Argo-managed secrets being present in the namespace. If a secret is missing, create it via Argo/GitOps first.
- Runtime configuration for `apps-www-ameide-platform-tilt` (e.g., `AUTH_URL`, `AUTH_KEYCLOAK_ISSUER`, `AUTH_SECRET`, Redis/DB URLs) is derived from the same Helm values/ExternalSecrets chain as the Argo baseline. The devcontainer must not be treated as a source of truth for these app env vars.
- If you need external access for other tilt services, add unique hosts in their tilt values and ensure DNS covers them.
- Cleanup of `*-tilt` releases on Tilt stop is not automated (optional follow-up).
- Keycloak client (`platform-app`) must allow local host callbacks: `platform.local.ameide.io` is present in redirect/web origins in the shared realm values (see 426-keycloak-config-map.md), and the Next.js dev server allows the local origin via `allowedDevOrigins`.

---

## Follow-ups (optional)
- Add tilt hosts for other services as needed.
- Optional hook to delete `*-tilt` releases when Tilt stops.

# 425 – Vendor-owned schemas vs. Flyway-owned schemas

## Problem / Proposal

Now that Temporal’s persistence is handled by a dedicated Argo CD application (`data-migrations-temporal`) that runs the vendor-supported `temporal-sql-tool`, we have a concrete pattern for how vendor-owned schemas should be managed. This backlog explores what it would take to pivot fully to that model:

- **Vendors own their internal schemas** – we never attempt to apply or version their tables via Flyway.
- **Our application schemas stay consolidated** – Flyway remains the single entry point for Ameide-authored services.

## Current state

| Schema domain                      | Owner today                          | Tooling                                     |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Temporal default/visibility DBs   | `data-migrations-temporal` Argo app   | `temporal-sql-tool` (setup-schema, update)  |
| Keycloak, agents, workflows, etc. | `data-db-migrations` Argo app (Flyway) | Custom Flyway SQL under `/flyway/sql/**`    |

Some vendors (Temporal, CNPG) require their own tooling and provide clear “don’t touch” guidance. Others (e.g., third-party apps installed via Helm) may or may not have opinionated schema tooling.

## Desired end state

1. **Every vendor-provided product with protected schemas** declares and owns a dedicated migration component, similar to Temporal:
   - Example: if we adopt upstream Keycloak schema management (Liquibase or bundled tools), we create a `platform-keycloak-migrations` Argo app that runs their scripts before the Keycloak chart deploys.
   - Each vendor app’s Argo component lists its schema hook in dependencies to guarantee ordering.
2. **Flyway only manages Ameide-authored schemas**:
   - Services we build (agents, workflows, PG schemas for platform components) continue to share the `data-db-migrations` hook.
   - Flyway’s `existingSecrets` list shrinks to only Ameide-owned DB credentials; vendor secrets move to their respective hooks.
3. **Documentation and runbooks** explicitly call out which Argo app owns each schema and which tool to use for emergency fixes.

## Workstreams / Steps

1. **Inventory vendor-managed schemas**:
   - List every Helm chart / operator that owns its own persistence (Temporal, Keycloak, Prometheus, etc.) and determine whether upstream tooling exists for schema setup/upgrades.
   - Decide per vendor whether it’s worth delegating schema ownership (e.g., Keycloak may still be simpler via Flyway if upstream tooling is painful).
2. **Template a “vendor schema hook” chart**:
   - Base it on `temporal-migrations`: container image, secrets, pre-install/pre-upgrade hook, retry behavior, Prometheus-friendly logs.
   - Parameterize for `install_pkg`, CLI download, and command sequences.
3. **Migrate candidates**:
   - For each vendor we choose to delegate, add a new Argo component and shared values file (mirroring Temporal’s structure).
   - Remove the vendor’s secrets/env vars from `data-db-migrations`.
   - Update ordering in the ApplicationSet so vendor schemas run before their Helm chart, but after infrastructure (CNPG, Vault secrets).
4. **Update runbooks**:
   - Document how to rerun each vendor schema hook (e.g., `argocd app sync platform-keycloak-migrations`).
   - Note which tool/logs to inspect when a vendor schema fails.

## Risks / Open questions

- Some vendors may not have a CLI suitable for automation. If we cannot run their tool non-interactively, Flyway (or our own scripts) might remain the only option.
- Additional Argo apps increase dependency graph complexity. We need clear waves/rollout-phase annotations so that vendor schema hooks run before their workloads but after databases and secrets.
- Auditing: splitting secrets across multiple hooks means we must ensure each hook has only the credentials it needs and that RBAC remains tight.

## Definition of done

- Temporal pattern documented and applied to any other vendor that requires it.
- `data-db-migrations` owns only Ameide-authored schemas; all vendor internals are migrated elsewhere.
- Runbooks clearly specify “which Argo app to sync when schema X needs attention”.

## Step 1 – Inventory snapshot (2025-11-30)

| Component / Chart                                      | DB backend / storage                                                                             | Current migration owner                    | Vendor tooling available? | Notes / Next action                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Temporal** (`data-temporal`)                        | Postgres (`temporal`, `temporal_visibility` in CNPG cluster)                                      | `data-migrations-temporal` (vendor hook)  | Yes (`temporal-sql-tool`) | ✅ Already migrated to vendor flow (setup-schema + update-schema).                                     |
| **Keycloak** (`platform-keycloak`)                    | Postgres (`keycloak` DB managed by CNPG)                                                         | `data-db-migrations` (Flyway)             | **Yes** (Keycloak uses embedded Liquibase auto-migrations) | Needs exploration: upstream chart can run Liquibase on startup; evaluate replacing Flyway SQL with vendor hook. |
| **Prometheus / Alertmanager / Grafana stack**         | Prometheus TSDB, Alertmanager files, Grafana SQLite/Postgres (we currently run SQLite)           | Not applicable / in-container migrations  | Yes (managed internally)  | No relational schema we touch; nothing to migrate.                                                     |
| **MinIO, ClickHouse, Redis, CNPG operators**          | Each operator manages its own CRDs/state; no Ameide-authored SQL                                 | Operators themselves                      | Yes (operators reconcile) | Out of scope (no Flyway involvement today).                                                            |
| **Platform services (agents, workflows, threads, etc.)** | Postgres schemas (CNPG)                                                                           | `data-db-migrations` (Flyway)             | N/A (our code)            | Remain consolidated under Flyway.                                                                      |

Action item from this inventory: **Keycloak** is the only vendor product still using the shared Flyway job despite having native schema tooling (Liquibase baked into the Keycloak image). Next steps for step 2:

1. Validate whether the upstream Keycloak Helm chart exposes a hook/Job for Liquibase (or if we need to run the image with `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN` environment and `kc.sh start --optimized` to trigger migrations).
2. Decide if switching reduces risk vs. current Flyway SQL (which we maintain ourselves).
3. If yes, template a `platform-keycloak-migrations` chart following the Temporal pattern and remove Keycloak tables from Flyway.

If we uncover other vendor schemas later (e.g., future vendors with their own tooling), add them to this table.

# 426 – Keycloak configuration & GitOps map

**Status**: Draft  
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-01  
**Related**: 323-keycloak-realm-roles.md · 323-keycloak-realm-roles-v2.md · 333-realms.md · 364-argo-configuration-v5.md · 375-rolling-sync-wave-redesign.md · 418-secrets-strategy-map.md · infra/README.md

---

## 1. Purpose

Give a single, up-to-date view of how Keycloak is deployed and managed via GitOps:

- Which Argo CD Applications and charts make up the Keycloak stack.
- How instance vs realm vs admin secrets are split across layers.
- How health checks, sync waves, and operators interact.
- Where to look for deeper details (realm roles, multi-tenancy, secrets strategy).

This document is a **map** that ties together more detailed backlogs (323, 333, 364, 418) and the GitOps tree under `gitops/ameide-gitops`.

---

## 2. Component inventory (GitOps + Argo CD)

Keycloak is delivered as an operator-centric stack, split into **foundation** and **platform** layers.

**Argo CD Applications (dev):**

- `argocd/platform-keycloak-crds`  
  - **Responsibility**: Installs Keycloak CRDs (`Keycloak`, `KeycloakRealmImport`).  
  - **Source**: `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/charts/foundation/common/raw-manifests`  
    - Values: `.../sources/values/_shared/platform/platform-keycloak-crds.yaml` (+ dev overlay).  
  - **Notes**: Aligns with CRD guidance in 364‑argo-configuration-v5 (CRDs in their own Application, wave-gated).

- `argocd/foundation-keycloak-operator`  
  - **Responsibility**: Deploys the Keycloak Operator (controller + RBAC).  
  - **Source**: `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/charts/foundation/operators/keycloak-operator`  
    - CRDs vendored under `crds/`.  
  - **Notes**: Follows operator best practices; health is standard Deployment/Pod health (no custom Lua).

- `argocd/foundation-keycloak-admin-secrets`  
  - **Responsibility**: Owns Keycloak admin **ExternalSecrets** and the derived Kubernetes Secrets:
    - `ExternalSecret keycloak-bootstrap-admin-sync` → `Secret keycloak-bootstrap-admin`
    - `ExternalSecret keycloak-master-bootstrap-sync` → `Secret keycloak-master-bootstrap`
    - `ExternalSecret keycloak-master-platform-app-sync` → `Secret platform-app-master-client`  
  - **Source**: `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/charts/foundation/common/raw-manifests`  
    - Values: `.../sources/values/_shared/foundation/foundation-keycloak-admin-secrets.yaml` (+ env overlays).  
  - **Notes**: This is the sole owner of these ExternalSecrets in dev after the 2025‑12‑01 refactor (see §4).

- `argocd/platform-keycloak` (instance)  
  - **Responsibility**: Declares the **Keycloak** custom resource (instance: image, DB, hostname, probes, etc.).  
  - **Source**: `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/charts/foundation/operators-config/keycloak_instance`  
    - Shared values: `.../sources/charts/shared-values/infrastructure/keycloak.yaml`  
    - Platform shared overlay: `.../sources/values/_shared/platform/platform-keycloak.yaml`  
    - Env overlays: `.../sources/values/dev/platform/platform-keycloak.yaml`, `.../sources/values/production/platform/infrastructure/keycloak.yaml`, etc.  
  - **Notes**:
    - Uses `database.secretName: keycloak-db-credentials` (CNPG-owned; see backlog/412-cnpg-owned-postgres-greds.md).  
    - Uses `bootstrapAdmin.secretName: keycloak-bootstrap-admin` (produced by `foundation-keycloak-admin-secrets`).  
    - `externalSecrets.enabled` is **false** at the shared layer; dev no longer overrides this, so the instance consumes Secrets but does not own any ExternalSecrets.

- `argocd/platform-keycloak-realm` (realm config)  
  - **Responsibility**: Realm configuration (`ameide` realm, client scopes, clients, users) and bootstrap jobs.  
  - **Source**: `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/charts/foundation/operators-config/keycloak_realm`  
    - Values: `.../sources/values/_shared/platform/platform-keycloak-realm.yaml` + env overlays.  
  - **Key resources**:
    - `ConfigMap keycloak-realm-import` – JSON realm definitions (`ameide-realm.json`, etc.).  
    - `KeycloakRealmImport master-realm` / `ameide-realm` – declarative realm imports consumed by the operator.  
    - PostSync Jobs `platform-keycloak-realm-master-bootstrap`, `platform-keycloak-realm-client-patcher` – bootstrap the `roles` scope and service accounts (see 323‑keycloak-realm-roles-v2.md).
  - **Local host coverage**: The `platform-app` client includes `platform.local.ameide.io` in redirect/web origins to keep Tilt-only releases aligned with the shared Keycloak issuer (see 424-tilt-www-ameide-separate-release.md).

**Supporting components:**

- Gateway routing: `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/charts/apps/gateway/templates/httproute-keycloak.yaml`  
  - Routes `auth.dev.ameide.io` / `auth.ameide.io` to the in-cluster `keycloak` Service with `X-Forwarded-*` headers.  
  - Ties into the Envoy Gateway stack described in 364‑argo-configuration-v5.md and 417-envoy-route-tracking.md.

- Argo CD / Dex integration: `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/values/common/argocd.yaml`  
  - `dex.config` includes a Keycloak OIDC connector pointing at `http://keycloak.ameide.svc.cluster.local:8080/realms/ameide`, with client `argocd`.  
  - Depends on the `argocd-secret` wiring from `vault-secrets-argocd` (see 364‑argo-configuration-v5.md and infra/README.md).

- Validation helpers:
  - `infra/kubernetes/scripts/validate-keycloak.sh` – CLI script to validate operator, CR, pods, and realm imports.  
  - `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/charts/shared-values/tests/auth-smoke.yaml` – Argo/Helm test jobs that gate auth readiness (Keycloak CR `Ready`, pods Ready, secrets present, realm bootstrap job done).

---

## 3. Realm & roles configuration (tie-in to 323)

Realm behavior and role/tenant claims are governed by backlog 323:

- **Baseline realm**: single realm `ameide` (see 323-keycloak-realm-roles.md and 333-realms.md).  
  - `KeycloakRealmImport` CRDs (from the `keycloak_realm` chart) embed:
    - Client scopes: `roles`, `tenant`, `groups`, `organizations`.  
    - Default scopes configured per realm and per client (`platform-app`, `platform-app-master`, etc.).  
    - Clients and protocol mappers as described in 323‑v2 (e.g., `realm_access.roles`, `resource_access.${client_id}.roles`, `tenantId` from user attributes).

- **JWT expectations** (323‑v2):  
  - Access tokens include:
    - `realm_access.roles` – realm roles.  
    - `resource_access.{client}.roles` – client roles.  
    - `tenantId` – tenant context (until realm-per-tenant rollout completes).  
  - Application code uses these claims for RBAC and navigation (see 320-header.md, 322-rbac.md, 330-dynamic-tenant-resolution.md).

- **Realm-per-tenant target**:  
  - Longer-term goal (Section 4 of 323‑v2 and 333-realms.md) is to move to **realm-per-tenant** and drop the `tenant` and `groups` scopes.  
  - This backlog (426) documents the current single-realm baseline and how it is wired through GitOps; it does **not** change the realm-per-tenant roadmap or token shape described in 323‑v2.

---

## 4. Secrets & ownership model (tie-in to 418)

Backlog 418-secrets-strategy-map.md defines the high-level secrets posture (CNPG owns DB creds, Vault + External Secrets own app credentials, charts consume). Keycloak now conforms to that model:

- **Database credentials**  
  - Authority: CNPG (see 412-cnpg-owned-postgres-greds.md).  
  - Secret: `keycloak-db-credentials` in namespace `ameide`.  
  - Consumer: `platform-keycloak` via:
    - `database.secretName: keycloak-db-credentials`  
    - `db.existingSecret: keycloak-db-credentials` (for operator-side DB wiring).

- **Admin / bootstrap secrets**  
  - Authority: Vault + External Secrets, encapsulated by `foundation-keycloak-admin-secrets` (Layer 15).  
  - ExternalSecrets (foundation-owned, **not** owned by `platform-keycloak`):
    - `keycloak-bootstrap-admin-sync` → `Secret keycloak-bootstrap-admin`  
    - `keycloak-master-bootstrap-sync` → `Secret keycloak-master-bootstrap`  
    - `keycloak-master-platform-app-sync` → `Secret platform-app-master-client`  
  - Consumers:
    - `platform-keycloak` references `bootstrapAdmin.secretName: keycloak-bootstrap-admin`.  
    - `keycloak_realm` chart uses `platform-app-master-client` via placeholders in `KeycloakRealmImport` for service account credentials.

- **Refactor (2025‑12‑01)**  
  - Prior to this work, the dev overlay at `sources/values/dev/platform/platform-keycloak.yaml` re‑enabled the `externalSecrets` block for the instance, causing:
    - Argo SharedResourceWarning conditions.  
    - Ambiguous ownership of the three Keycloak admin ExternalSecrets.  
  - We removed that overlay so that:
    - `externalSecrets.enabled: false` at the shared `platform-keycloak` layer takes effect in dev.  
    - `foundation-keycloak-admin-secrets` is the **single authoritative owner** of the admin ExternalSecrets, matching the intent in 323‑v2 and 418.

- **What this buys us (relative to 418):**
  - Clear “who owns what” between CNPG, Vault/ExternalSecrets, and the Keycloak instance chart.  
  - No inline credentials in charts; all secrets are sourced from CNPG or Vault.  
  - A simpler rotation story: rotate database creds via CNPG; rotate admin creds via Vault/ExternalSecrets; Keycloak instance and realm charts are strictly consumers.

---

## 5. Health, sync behavior & loops (tie-in to 364, 419, 421)

Argo CD and the Keycloak Operator interact via CRDs and status conditions. This section captures the current health model and how we resolved the Keycloak realm import loop.

- **CRDs + operator readiness**  
  - `platform-keycloak-crds` installs CRDs and uses standard Argo health.  
  - `foundation-keycloak-operator` deploys the operator; readiness is derived from Deployment/Pod status and smoke tests (`auth-smoke` in shared-values/tests).

- **Keycloak instance (`Keycloak` CR)**  
  - Argo Application: `platform-keycloak`.  
  - Health today is based on the operator’s `.status.conditions` for `Keycloak` plus basic Kubernetes health; the instance is considered Healthy when the operator reports Ready and pods are running.  
  - Scripts and smoke tests:
    - `infra/kubernetes/scripts/validate-keycloak.sh` checks the operator, `Keycloak` CR, pods, and realm imports.  
    - `auth-smoke.yaml` includes checks for the `Keycloak` CR `Ready` condition and pods.

- **Realm imports (`KeycloakRealmImport` CRs)**  
  - Argo health customization in `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/values/common/argocd.yaml`:
    - `resource.customizations.health.k8s.keycloak.org_KeycloakRealmImport` inspects `.status.conditions` while the CR exists:
      - `HasErrors=True` → `Degraded`  
      - `Done=True` → `Healthy`  
      - `Started=True` → `Progressing`  
      - Otherwise → `Progressing` (“Waiting for realm import”).  
  - Vendor guidance treats `KeycloakRealmImport` as an **ephemeral, create-only** resource: it bootstraps a realm and is deleted after a successful import, rather than serving as long-lived configuration.
  - Our GitOps implementation follows that model by:
    - Annotating each `KeycloakRealmImport` rendered by `keycloak_realm/templates/realm-import.yaml` as an Argo CD `PostSync` hook with `argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PostSync` and `argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: HookSucceeded` (plus `sync-wave: "10"`).  
    - Allowing Argo to create the CR at the end of the sync, wait for `Done=True` / `HasErrors` via the health Lua, and then prune the CR once the import succeeds.  
    - Relying on the operator’s create-only semantics: re-running the same RealmImport on later syncs does not update or delete existing realms; it is effectively a no-op when the realm is already present.

- **Argo orchestration & waves**  
  - The ordering follows the RollingSync and wave design in 364‑argo-configuration-v5.md and 375-rolling-sync-wave-redesign.md:
    - CRDs → operator → secrets (Vault / ExternalSecrets) → Keycloak instance → realm config / imports → dependent services (Dex, gateway routes, apps).  
  - This ensures:
    - The operator is live before `Keycloak` / `KeycloakRealmImport` CRs appear.  
    - Admin secrets exist before Keycloak tries to bootstrap admin users or service accounts.  
    - Dex and the gateway are wired only after the `ameide` realm is reachable.

  - `infra/kubernetes/scripts/validate-keycloak.sh` – operator/realm validation.  
  - `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/charts/shared-values/tests/auth-smoke.yaml` – auth smoke tests run via Argo Helm test jobs.

**Future work for this backlog (426):**

- [ ] Add an explicit `Keycloak` CR health customization in `argocd-cm` mirroring the operator’s `Ready` condition (following the pattern used for Strimzi/Kafka).  
- [ ] Document a rotation runbook for admin credentials (`keycloak-bootstrap-admin`, `keycloak-master-bootstrap`, `platform-app-master-client`) that ties Vault paths → ExternalSecrets → Keycloak operator behavior.  
- [ ] Update this map once realm-per-tenant becomes the default, especially how realm imports and Keycloak instances are templated per organization.

## 427-platform-login-stability.md

# 427 – Platform /login Stability and Performance

**Status:** Phase 1–3 complete; layouts split, `/login` uses a public layout with no server-side auth, and middleware-only session validation (with `safeAuth` fully removed) is in place for protected routes.
**Intent:** Fix the upstream connection resets on `/login`, reduce 70+ second SSR compilation times, and eliminate `/healthz` JSON parse errors. Root causes are blocking Redis/RPC operations in the SSR path, missing error handling, and layout coupling.

---

## Symptoms

1. **`/login` upstream resets:** Envoy logs show `upstream_reset_before_response_started{connection_termination}` for `/login` requests to both `platform.dev.ameide.io` (Argo baseline) and `platform.local.ameide.io` (Tilt).

2. **70+ second compilation:** First request to `/login` on Tilt takes 70-90 seconds due to cascading SSR operations (Redis connect, org fetch, dynamic imports).

3. **`/healthz` JSON error:** Occasional `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input` at `/healthz`, causing probe failures.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. `/login` Upstream Resets

The reset occurs because Next.js drops connections during SSR compilation. The request path blocks on multiple slow operations:

```
Browser → Envoy → Next.js App
                      ↓
              RootLayout.tsx (async)
                      ↓
              await safeAuth()
                      ↓
              await getSession() → auth.ts JWT callback
                      ↓
              ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │  BLOCKING OPERATIONS:                        │
              │  1. Redis connect() - up to 10s timeout      │
              │  2. getTokens() - Redis GET                  │
              │  3. applyOrganizationContext():              │
              │     - fetchOrganizationContexts() - gRPC     │
              │     - fetchOrganizationMembershipRoles()     │
              │  4. Dynamic imports (await import())         │
              └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key code paths:**
- `services/www_ameide_platform/app/layout.tsx:61` — `session = await safeAuth()` runs on every request
- `services/www_ameide_platform/app/(auth)/auth.ts:836` — `await applyOrganizationContext()` makes 2-3 RPC calls
- `services/www_ameide_platform/lib/cache/redis.ts:109` — `await cache.connecting` blocks until Redis ready

When these operations stall, the connection drops before a response is sent. Envoy interprets this as `upstream_reset_before_response_started`.

### 2. 70+ Second `/login` Compilation

Multiple expensive operations compound during first-request SSR:

| Operation | Location | Time Impact |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Redis Sentinel connection | `lib/cache/redis.ts:35-58` | 1-10s (10s timeout) |
| Organization context fetch | `app/(auth)/auth.ts:174-440` | 5-20s (2-3 gRPC calls) |
| Dynamic imports in JWT callback | `app/(auth)/auth.ts:822,952` | 0.5-2s per import |
| OpenTelemetry init (if configured) | `lib/telemetry-init.ts` | 2-10s |
| Google Fonts loading | `app/layout.tsx:22-32` | Variable |

**Cumulative worst case:** 20-50+ seconds for SSR on first request.

### 3. `/healthz` JSON Parse Error

The `/healthz` route itself is trivial (`app/healthz/route.ts`), but the error originates from Redis cache operations retrieving corrupted/incomplete data:

```typescript
// lib/cache/redis.ts:117-119 - NO error handling around JSON.parse
async get<T = unknown>(key: string): Promise<T | null> {
  const val = await this.client.get(nsKey(key, this.config.namespace));
  return val ? (JSON.parse(val) as T) : null;  // ← THROWS if val is malformed
}
```

When Redis returns truncated/corrupted session data, `JSON.parse()` throws `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input`. This propagates through session store → safeAuth → RootLayout.

Although `/healthz` is excluded from middleware (`proxy.ts:217`), if it shares the RootLayout that calls `safeAuth()`, the error can surface.

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Stability Fixes

**1.1 Add error handling to Redis `get()` method**

File: `services/www_ameide_platform/lib/cache/redis.ts`

```typescript
async get<T = unknown>(key: string): Promise<T | null> {
  const val = await this.client.get(nsKey(key, this.config.namespace));
  if (!val) return null;
  try {
    return JSON.parse(val) as T;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('[REDIS] Failed to parse cached value', { key, error: err });
    // Optionally delete the corrupted key
    await this.del(key).catch(() => {});
    return null;
  }
}
```

**1.2 Ensure `/healthz` bypasses RootLayout entirely**

Implement `/healthz` as a standalone route without any app layout or auth/session wiring. In practice, this is done by:
- Placing the handler at `app/healthz/route.ts`
- Exporting `export const dynamic = 'force-static'`
- Excluding `/healthz` from middleware matching so NextAuth is never invoked for probes

**1.3 Reduce Redis connection timeout for dev**

File: `services/www_ameide_platform/lib/cache/redis.ts`

```typescript
connectTimeout: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 10000 : 3000,
```

---

### Phase 2: Performance Optimizations

**2.1 Skip organization fetching for unauthenticated requests**

The `/login` page doesn't need organization context — it just redirects to Keycloak. Modify `applyOrganizationContext()` to skip RPC calls for unauthenticated users or during initial sign-in setup.

File: `services/www_ameide_platform/app/(auth)/auth.ts`

```typescript
// Early return if no tenantId (unauthenticated or pre-signin)
if (!enrichedToken.tenantId) {
  return;
}
```

**2.2 Convert dynamic imports to static imports**

File: `services/www_ameide_platform/app/(auth)/auth.ts`

Replace:
```typescript
const { extractRealmFromIssuer } = await import('@/lib/auth/realm-discovery');
const { upsertUserFromKeycloak } = await import('@/lib/users');
```

With top-level imports:
```typescript
import { extractRealmFromIssuer } from '@/lib/auth/realm-discovery';
import { upsertUserFromKeycloak } from '@/lib/users';
```

**2.3 Add Redis connection warmup**

File: `services/www_ameide_platform/lib/cache/redis.ts`

```typescript
export async function warmupRedis(): Promise<void> {
  const cache = new RedisCache({ namespace: 'warmup' });
  await cache.connect();
  console.log('[REDIS] Connection pool warmed up');
}
```

Call from `instrumentation.node.ts` during app startup.

**2.4 Cache organization context in Redis with TTL**

Instead of fetching organizations on every token refresh:

```typescript
const cacheKey = `org-ctx:${userId}:${tenantId}`;
let orgs = await cache.get<OrganizationContext[]>(cacheKey);
if (!orgs) {
  orgs = await fetchOrganizationContexts(tenantId, userId, orgSlugs);
  await cache.set(cacheKey, orgs, 300); // 5 min TTL
}
```

---

### Phase 3: Architectural Improvements

**3.1 Split RootLayout for public vs authenticated routes**

Target layout shape:

```
app/
  (public)/           ← Minimal layout, no server-side auth()
    login/
    register/
  (app)/              ← Authenticated app routes (use middleware headers, not auth())
    org/[orgId]/
    onboarding/
  healthz/route.ts    ← Standalone health check (no layout, force-static)
```

**3.2 Add circuit breaker for backend RPC calls**

If the platform service is slow/down, don't block auth:

```typescript
async function fetchOrganizationsWithTimeout(
  tenantId: string, userId: string, orgSlugs: string[], timeoutMs = 5000
): Promise<OrganizationContext[]> {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), timeoutMs);
  try {
    return await fetchOrganizationContexts(tenantId, userId, orgSlugs);
  } catch (err) {
    if (err.name === 'AbortError') {
      console.warn('[auth] Organization fetch timed out, continuing without org context');
      return [];
    }
    throw err;
  } finally {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  }
}
```

**3.3 Move session validation to middleware-only for protected routes**

Current state:
- Middleware (Edge) validates the session and enforces access control for protected routes; RootLayout no longer performs any server-side session validation and simply hydrates client-side providers.
- Middleware injects `x-pathname`, `x-tenant-id`, `x-user-id`, `x-user-kc-sub`, and `x-org-home` headers derived from the Edge session so server components can avoid re-running heavy auth logic.
- The authenticated app layout (`app/(app)/layout.tsx`) reads `x-pathname` and `x-tenant-id` to resolve the navigation descriptor instead of calling `auth()`/`safeAuth()`.
- The organization layout (`app/(app)/org/[orgId]/layout.tsx`) uses `x-tenant-id`, `x-user-kc-sub`, and `x-user-id` to resolve and load organizations without invoking `auth()`/`safeAuth()`.
- The home redirect (`app/page.tsx`) uses `x-org-home` for the target organization/home route and falls back to `/login` when middleware context is missing, instead of calling `safeAuth()`.
- The `safeAuth` helper has been removed entirely. Session introspection now happens only where strictly required:
  - Navigation access control (`getUserAccess`) via `getSession()` in `app/(auth)/auth.ts`.
  - Development/test API endpoints (`/api/auth/debug`, `/api/test/userinfo`) that intentionally inspect the full session via `getSession()`.

---

## Verification Commands

```bash
# 1. Test /healthz bypasses auth (should be instant)
kubectl exec -n ameide deployment/apps-www-ameide-platform-tilt -- \
  curl -s -w '\nTime: %{time_total}s\n' http://localhost:3001/healthz

# 2. Test /login timing (check compilation time)
kubectl exec -n ameide deployment/apps-www-ameide-platform-tilt -- \
  curl -s -w '\nTime: %{time_total}s\n' -o /dev/null http://localhost:3001/login

# 3. Check Redis connectivity from pod
kubectl exec -n ameide deployment/apps-www-ameide-platform-tilt -- \
  env | grep REDIS

# 4. Check platform service health (for org fetch)
kubectl get pods -n ameide -l app=platform

# 5. Test via Envoy with explicit resolve
curl -vk --resolve platform.local.ameide.io:443:172.18.0.5 \
  https://platform.local.ameide.io/healthz
```

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/layout.tsx` | RootLayout — no server-side session validation; hydrates global providers with `session = null` and relies on middleware + client-side session for auth state |
| `app/(app)/layout.tsx` | Authenticated app layout — uses `x-pathname` and `x-tenant-id` headers from middleware to resolve navigation, never calls `auth()`/`safeAuth()` |
| `app/page.tsx` | Home redirect — uses `x-org-home` header from middleware to route users to their org home or onboarding; falls back to `/login` when middleware context is missing (no server-side session lookup) |
| `app/(auth)/auth.ts` | NextAuth config — JWT callback, token refresh, org fetch |
| `lib/cache/redis.ts` | Redis client — connection and JSON parsing |
| `lib/session-store.ts` | Redis-backed session storage |
| `lib/sdk/organizations.ts` | Organization context fetch (gRPC) |
| `app/healthz/route.ts` | Health check endpoint |
| `proxy.ts` | Middleware — route matching and auth |

---

## Dependencies

- Redis Sentinel must be reachable within 3-10s (reduce timeout in dev)
- Platform service must respond to organization queries within 5s
- Keycloak must be healthy for token refresh

---

## Implementation Log

### 2025-12-01: Phase 1-2 Implementation

**Changes made:**

1. **Redis error handling** (`lib/cache/redis.ts`):
   - Added try/catch around `JSON.parse()` in `get()` method
   - Returns `null` instead of throwing on corrupted data
   - Best-effort cleanup of corrupted entries

2. **`/healthz` isolation** (`app/healthz/route.ts`):
   - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` to bypass SSR auth
   - Route now responds in ~40-200ms consistently

3. **Redis timeout reduction** (`lib/cache/redis.ts`):
   - Dev timeout reduced to 3s (from 10s)
   - Production remains at 10s

4. **Circuit breaker for org fetch** (`lib/sdk/organizations.ts`):
   - Added `fetchOrganizationContextsWithTimeout()` with 5s timeout
   - Returns empty array on timeout instead of blocking auth flow

5. **Static imports** (`app/(auth)/auth.ts`):
   - Converted 6 dynamic `await import()` calls to static imports
   - Reduces per-request module loading overhead

6. **Redis warmup** (`lib/cache/redis.ts`, `instrumentation.node.ts`):
   - Added `warmupRedis()` function called during app startup
   - Prevents first request from waiting for Redis connection

**Test results:**
- `/healthz` responds in ~40-200ms (was occasionally timing out)
- Baseline pod (`apps-www-ameide-platform`) shows stable healthz responses
- Tilt pod has Redis authentication issue (environment config, not code)

### 2025-12-01: Phase 3 Implementation - Route Group Split

**Changes made:**

1. **Created `(public)` route group** (`app/(public)/layout.tsx`):
   - Minimal layout that avoids any server-side session validation
   - Provides theming (ThemeProvider) and toast notifications
   - Skips SessionProvider, QueryClient, and Transport providers (not needed for public routes)
   - Imports `globals.css` via relative path

2. **Moved `/login` to public route group**:
   - `app/(public)/login/page.tsx` - client-side login page
   - `app/(public)/login/KeycloakRedirect.tsx` - Keycloak redirect component
   - Removed old `app/(auth)/login/` directory

**Route structure after refactor:**
```
app/
  layout.tsx              ← RootLayout; no server-side auth, shared theming/providers
  (public)/
    layout.tsx            ← PublicLayout (no auth), wraps unauthenticated pages
    login/
      page.tsx            ← Login page (fast, client-only redirect prep)
      KeycloakRedirect.tsx
  (auth)/
    auth.ts               ← NextAuth config (API routes + getSession/auth/signIn/signOut)
    register/route.ts     ← API route (returns HTML, no layout)
    logout/route.ts       ← API route
  (app)/
    ...                   ← Authenticated app routes (guarded by middleware)
  (onboarding)/
    ...                   ← Onboarding routes
  healthz/route.ts        ← Health check (force-static)
```

**Test results (2025-12-01):**

```
# Redis warmup working:
[REDIS] Connecting via Sentinel to redis:26379 (master: mymaster)
[REDIS] Connection pool warmed up successfully
[REDIS] Connected to master node

# /healthz consistently fast:
GET /healthz 200 in 50-200ms

# /login first request (webpack compilation):
GET /login 200 in 87s (compile: 83s, proxy.ts: 729ms, render: 3.5s)

# /login subsequent requests (cached):
HTTP Status: 200, Time: 4.65s
HTTP Status: 200, Time: 6.21s
```

**Performance improvement:**
- `/login` first request: ~87s (mostly Next.js webpack compilation - unavoidable in dev mode)
- `/login` subsequent requests: **~4-6 seconds** (down from 70+ seconds when server-side auth ran in RootLayout)
- `/healthz`: **50-200ms** consistently

Note: The first-request compilation time is a Next.js dev-mode behavior. In production builds, the routes are pre-compiled and should respond in ~100-500ms.

---

### 2025-12-01: Phase 3.3 – SafeAuth removal and middleware-only validation

**Changes made:**

1. **Home redirect simplified** (`services/www_ameide_platform/app/page.tsx`):
   - Now uses only the `x-org-home` header from middleware to determine the destination.
   - If the header is missing or empty, the route treats the request as unauthenticated and redirects to `/login` instead of calling `safeAuth()`/`getSession()`.

2. **`safeAuth` helper removed**:
   - Deleted `services/www_ameide_platform/app/(auth)/safe-auth.ts`.
   - All former `safeAuth()` call sites were updated:
     - Navigation features (`lib/auth/org-scope.ts`, `features/navigation/server/features.ts`) no longer depend on `safeAuth()`; `org-scope` is now explicitly deprecated in favor of middleware headers and organization layouts, and feature fetching relies only on `resolveOrganizationId` + tenant headers.
     - Debug and test endpoints (`app/api/auth/debug/route.ts`, `app/api/test/userinfo/route.ts`) now call `getSession()` directly when they need full session details.

3. **Public layout documentation updated** (`app/(public)/layout.tsx`):
   - Clarified that the public layout performs no server-side session validation or NextAuth `auth()` calls, avoiding Redis-backed session lookup and org-context fetching entirely for `/login` and `/register`.

4. **Navigation feature tests aligned** (`features/navigation/server/__tests__/unit/features.test.ts`):
   - Removed mocks and expectations around `safeAuth()`.
   - Tests now assert a single `resolveOrganizationId` call using the provided `tenantId` and `userId` parameters.

**Resulting behavior:**
- No production request path invokes `safeAuth()`, and the helper no longer exists.
- All auth gating for protected routes is enforced in `proxy.ts` (middleware), with server components consuming middleware-injected headers instead of re-running expensive auth logic.
- Session introspection via `getSession()` remains limited to:
  - Navigation access control (`getUserAccess`) where role information is required.
  - Explicit debug/test endpoints that are disabled in production by default.

## 428-onboarding.md

# 428: Consolidated Onboarding & Identity Provisioning

**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2025-12-01
**Owner:** Platform / Identity
**Supersedes:** backlog/319-onboarding.md, backlog/369-onboarding-v2.md, backlog/319-onboarding-v4.md

---

## Executive Summary

This backlog consolidates all onboarding-related requirements from prior specifications (319, 369, 319-v4) into a single, prioritized execution plan. It covers the complete journey from lead capture through fully-provisioned tenant, incorporating lessons learned and aligning with the current architecture (realm-per-tenant, Temporal orchestration, unified secret guardrails).

---

## 1. Current State Assessment

### What Works (Production Ready)

| Component | Status | Implementation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Frontend Wizard | ✅ | 3-step onboarding UI in `app/(app)/onboarding/page.tsx` |
| Middleware Gate | ✅ | Forces new users to complete onboarding before app access |
| Registration API | ✅ | `POST /api/v1/registrations/complete` with tenant validation |
| Identity Orchestrator | ✅ | `features/identity/lib/orchestrator.ts` - atomic org/membership creation |
| Invitation System | ✅ | 7 endpoints: create, validate, accept, revoke, resend, list |
| Token Security | ✅ | SHA-256 hashing, one-time use, expiration |
| Database Schema | ✅ | Organizations, memberships, roles, invitations, users, teams |
| RLS Enforcement | ✅ | Row-level security on platform tables |
| JWT Tenant Claims | ✅ | `tenantId` claim via Keycloak protocol mapper |
| RBAC Roles | ✅ | admin, contributor, viewer, guest, service (canonical catalog) |

### Current Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Remediation |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Keycloak realm provisioning (403) | Self-serve tenant creation fails | Restore `realm-admin` + `create-realm` roles to `platform-app-master` |
| Platform service disabled | Organization creation throws `ConnectError` | Enable platform Helm release |
| Tenant catalog automation | No `pending_onboarding` → `active` transition | Implement status workflow job |
| Admin token cache invalidation | Provisioned realms lack scoped permissions | Refresh token cache after realm creation |

### Not Implemented (Gaps)

| Feature | Priority | Phase |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Email delivery (invitations, verification) | High | 1 |
| Event-driven provisioning (outbox + bus) | High | 2 |
| Domain discovery & verification | Medium | 2 |
| Corporate SSO (IdP brokering) | Medium | 2 |
| SSO enforcement & JIT auto-join | Medium | 2 |
| SCIM 2.0 provisioning | Low | 3 |
| Billing/entitlements integration | Medium | 3 |
| WebAuthn/Passwordless MFA | Low | 3 |
| Audit logging (structured) | Medium | 2 |
| Rate limiting on bootstrap | High | 1 |

## 2. Architecture

### Two-Level Tenancy Model

```
DEPLOYMENT (Kubernetes Cluster)
  └── TENANT (Infrastructure Isolation)
       ├── Keycloak Realm (realm-per-tenant)
       ├── Database Schema (RLS policies)
       └── ORGANIZATION (User Workspace)
            ├── Memberships (user ↔ org with roles)
            ├── Teams (functional groupings)
            └── Invitations (pending joins)
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Realm-Per-Tenant**: Each organization gets its own Keycloak realm for complete identity isolation (see backlog/333-realms.md)
2. **JWT-Based Tenant Resolution**: `tenantId` flows from Keycloak → session → all services
3. **No Hardcoded Fallbacks**: API routes fail-secure when tenantId missing
4. **Temporal Orchestration**: Long-running onboarding workflows via Temporal (target architecture)
5. **Vault-Managed Secrets**: All credentials via ExternalSecrets (see backlog/362-unified-secret-guardrails.md)

### Keycloak Capacity & Sharding Strategy

> ⚠️ **Scalability Constraint**: Keycloak realm-per-tenant does not scale linearly to 10k+ realms per cluster.

**Observed Limits (Keycloak 26.x)**:
- Community reports performance degradation beyond ~300-500 realms
- With aggressive cache tuning, ~1000 realms is achievable but requires dedicated capacity planning
- 10k tenants per cluster with realm-per-tenant is **not realistically supported** by current Keycloak

**Sharding Strategy**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    KEYCLOAK SHARDING MODEL                              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                         │
│  Tier 1: Enterprise Accounts (realm-per-tenant)                         │
│    - Dedicated Keycloak realm per organization                          │
│    - Full SSO/SCIM/IdP brokering capabilities                           │
│    - Max ~500 realms per Keycloak cluster                               │
│    - Route by tenant → Keycloak shard (tenant_keycloak_shard_id)        │
│                                                                         │
│  Tier 2: SMB/Self-Serve Accounts (shared realm)                         │
│    - Shared `ameide` realm with group-based tenant isolation            │
│    - JWT `tenantId` claim from user attributes                          │
│    - No per-tenant IdP brokering (use social/email auth)                │
│    - Scales to 100k+ tenants per Keycloak cluster                       │
│                                                                         │
│  Upgrade Path: SMB → Enterprise                                         │
│    - Migrate user from shared realm to dedicated realm                  │
│    - Link existing platform.users/memberships to new realm              │
│    - One-time migration workflow (Temporal)                             │
│                                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Capacity Planning**:
| Metric | Phase 1 Target | Phase 5 Target | Notes |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Realms per Keycloak cluster | 50 | 500 | Load test required at 100, 250, 500 |
| Total tenants (all tiers) | 1,000 | 10,000 | Hybrid model enables scale |
| Keycloak clusters (production) | 1 | 2-3 | Shard by tenant tier + region |

**Implementation Notes**:
- Add `keycloak_shard_id` column to `platform.tenants` table
- Realm provisioner client (`realm-provisioner`) uses minimal scopes per shard
- Token cache refresh is shard-aware
- Monitoring: alert when any shard exceeds 80% realm capacity

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: Self-Serve Signup (B2C)
- **FR-1.1**: User registers via Keycloak (email/password or social)
- **FR-1.2**: Middleware detects missing organization, redirects to `/onboarding`
- **FR-1.3**: Wizard collects organization name/slug in ≤ 3 screens
- **FR-1.4**: System creates organization + owner membership atomically
- **FR-1.5**: User redirected to `/org/{slug}/dashboard` on success
- **FR-1.6**: Tenant realm provisioned if realm-per-tenant is enabled

#### FR-2: Invitation Flow
- **FR-2.1**: Org admin creates invitation with email + role
- **FR-2.2**: System generates secure token (SHA-256 hashed)
- **FR-2.3**: Invitation email sent with acceptance link
- **FR-2.4**: Invitee authenticates (existing or new account)
- **FR-2.5**: System validates token, creates membership
- **FR-2.6**: Duplicate invitations handled gracefully

#### FR-3: Enterprise SSO (B2B)
- **FR-3.1**: Domain discovery API returns IdP requirements
- **FR-3.2**: Verified domains enforce SSO authentication
- **FR-3.3**: JIT provisioning creates membership on first SSO login
- **FR-3.4**: Admin configures IdP via self-service wizard
- **FR-3.5**: SCIM 2.0 endpoint for automated provisioning
- **FR-3.6**: SCIM endpoints support filtering (`userName`, `externalId`, `id`), pagination (`startIndex`, `count`), and PATCH semantics
- **FR-3.7**: SCIM endpoints secured with OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens scoped to single organization

#### FR-3.8: Identity Source-of-Truth & Precedence

When multiple identity sources are configured, the following precedence applies:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    IDENTITY SOURCE PRECEDENCE                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                         │
│  1. SCIM (highest authority when enabled)                               │
│     - SCIM is authoritative source of memberships when configured       │
│     - SCIM DELETE → deactivates account (no login), does NOT purge data │
│     - SCIM-disabled accounts CANNOT be re-activated by JIT              │
│                                                                         │
│  2. JIT Provisioning                                                    │
│     - Creates membership on first SSO login if user not SCIM-managed    │
│     - Creates "candidate" user if SCIM is enabled but hasn't synced yet │
│     - JIT respects domain SSO enforcement                               │
│                                                                         │
│  3. Manual Invitations                                                  │
│     - Blocked when SCIM is active for the organization                  │
│     - Allowed for non-SCIM orgs or for roles SCIM doesn't manage        │
│                                                                         │
│  Edge Cases:                                                            │
│     - Personal email user + later company SSO enforcement:              │
│       User must link account or create new org account                  │
│     - SSO enforced but SCIM hasn't provisioned user:                    │
│       JIT creates candidate membership with default role                │
│     - SCIM deprovision + user attempts SSO:                             │
│       Access denied (SCIM authority preserved)                          │
│                                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### FR-4: Provisioning
- **FR-4.1**: Tenant realm created with proper admin permissions
- **FR-4.2**: Default roles seeded in new organizations
- **FR-4.3**: Default workspace/project created (optional)
- **FR-4.4**: Events emitted for downstream consumers
- **FR-4.5**: Provisioning status visible to user

#### FR-5: Billing Integration

> **Design Principle**: Stripe (or billing provider) is the **source of truth** for subscription state. Platform DB stores a projection updated via webhooks, never mutated directly.

- **FR-5.1**: Plan selection during onboarding (optional, feature-flagged)
- **FR-5.2**: Default path: sign up → trial environment → payment capture before trial ends
- **FR-5.3**: Payment-before-provisioning is **opt-in** for enterprise contracts only
- **FR-5.4**: Subscription created with configurable trial period (default: 14 days)
- **FR-5.5**: Seat limits enforced on membership creation (invites blocked when at limit)
- **FR-5.6**: `subscriptions.status`, dates, and plan updated **only via provider webhooks**
- **FR-5.7**: Usage records keyed by `(organization_id, metric_key, period, external_usage_id)` for idempotency

**Grace Period & Blocking Behavior**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    SUBSCRIPTION STATE TRANSITIONS                        │

## 4. Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Stabilize Core Path (Sprint 1-2)

**Objective**: End-to-end self-serve signup completes without manual intervention

| Task | Owner | Estimate | Dependencies |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| 1.1 Restore Keycloak `platform-app-master` permissions | Infra | 2h | - |
| 1.2 Enable platform Helm release | Infra | 1h | - |
| 1.3 Implement admin token cache refresh after realm creation | Platform | 4h | 1.1 |
| 1.4 Add `pending_onboarding` → `active` status automation | Platform | 4h | 1.2 |
| 1.5 Add rate limiting to `/api/v1/registrations/bootstrap` | Platform | 2h | - |
| 1.6 Add instrumentation/metrics to bootstrap endpoint | Platform | 2h | - |
| 1.7 E2E test: complete signup flow with healthy backend | QA | 4h | 1.1-1.4 |

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] New user can complete signup without errors
- [ ] Organization created with owner membership
- [ ] Keycloak realm provisioned (if enabled)
- [ ] Bootstrap endpoint rate-limited and instrumented

#### Phase 1 – Implementation Progress

**Status by Task**

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 Restore Keycloak `platform-app-master` permissions | ✅ Implemented in config; confirm in target clusters | `master-realm.json` grants `create-realm` / `admin` to `service-account-platform-app` and `service-account-platform-app-master` (see `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/charts/foundation/operators-config/keycloak_realm/values.yaml`). ExternalSecrets (`foundation-keycloak-admin-secrets.yaml`) provision the admin credentials, and `platform-keycloak-realm` wiring ensures the master bootstrap and admin client secret sync are in place. Cluster operators should verify these roles are active in live Keycloak instances. |
| 1.2 Enable platform Helm release | ✅ Declared and wired via gitops | The core platform service is defined as a Helm release (`apps-platform` in `gitops/ameide-gitops/environments/*/components/apps/core/platform/component.yaml`) and uses environment-specific values under `sources/values/*/platform`. Additional infrastructure (Keycloak, gateway, PostgreSQL) is enabled via `platform` components; enabling the platform path in a given cluster is now an operational toggle (syncing those components) rather than an implementation gap. |
| 1.3 Implement admin token cache refresh after realm creation | ✅ Implemented | `createTenantRealm` in `services/www_ameide_platform/lib/keycloak-admin.ts` calls `invalidateAdminTokenCache(config)` after creating the new realm, then obtains a fresh admin token to configure the realm client and service account. |
| 1.4 Add `pending_onboarding` → `active` status automation | ✅ Implemented | `services/platform/src/tenants/service.ts` creates tenants with status `pending_onboarding`; `IdentityOrchestrator.completeRegistration` (`services/www_ameide_platform/features/identity/lib/orchestrator.ts`) calls `client.tenants.updateTenant` with `status: TenantStatus.ACTIVE` and slug/realm metadata once organization + owner membership are created. |
| 1.5 Add rate limiting to `/api/v1/registrations/bootstrap` | ✅ Implemented | `services/www_ameide_platform/app/api/v1/registrations/bootstrap/route.ts` now enforces a per-user in-memory limit of **10 bootstrap attempts per hour**, returning `429` with `Retry-After` and a structured JSON error. Covered by a new integration test in `features/onboarding/__tests__/integration/registration-api.test.ts`. |
| 1.6 Add instrumentation/metrics to bootstrap endpoint | ✅ Implemented | The bootstrap route was already wrapped in `withRequestTelemetry` and now also records OpenTelemetry metrics via `services/www_ameide_platform/lib/onboarding-metrics.ts` (`onboarding_bootstrap_requests_total`, `onboarding_bootstrap_errors_total`, `onboarding_bootstrap_rate_limit_hits_total`, `onboarding_bootstrap_duration_seconds`) with status + HTTP code tags. |
| 1.7 E2E test: complete signup flow with healthy backend | ✅ Test suite implemented; cluster-only E2E | A full onboarding journey is covered in Playwright (`services/www_ameide_platform/features/onboarding/__tests__/e2e/onboarding-flow.spec.ts` and `new-user-redirect.spec.ts`) including tenant bootstrap, organization creation, redirect behavior, and post-onboarding access. These suites are designed as **cluster-only UI E2Es** (they require live Keycloak + platform and seeded data) and run whenever `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE=cluster` is set for the Playwright job. Dual-mode (`INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE=mock|cluster`) applies to backend integration packs; the onboarding UI flows are exercised only in cluster environments, not in mocked mode. |

**Integration Test Dual-Mode Alignment (376)**

- Onboarding E2E tests explicitly follow the dual-mode contract:
  - Cluster runs use `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE=cluster` and point at the in-cluster `www-ameide-platform` service (`gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/values/local/integration-tests/playwright.yaml`), exercising real Keycloak + platform flows end-to-end.
  - Mocked-mode integration for onboarding remains limited to unit/integration tests that stub gRPC and database dependencies; no attempt is made to run the Playwright signup journey in `mock` mode.
- `tools/integration-runner` and the Playwright integration values ensure `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE` is always set explicitly; unknown values fail fast per #376, and cluster-mode tests are never run implicitly from local/devcontainer workflows.

**Additional Work Completed (Beyond Initial Phase 1 Tasks)**

- **Stricter realm configuration guarantees**
  - `getKeycloakConfig` in `services/www_ameide_platform/lib/keycloak-admin.ts` now requires that `AUTH_KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` include a `/realms/<realm>` segment; it no longer falls back to a default realm. Misconfigured issuers fail fast with a clear error message.
  - Gitops already provides explicit issuers per environment (e.g. `https://auth.dev.ameide.io/realms/ameide`, `https://auth.ameide.io/realms/ameide`) via `keycloak.issuer`, making the realm effectively mandatory.

- **Onboarding telemetry improvements**
  - Introduced a dedicated onboarding meter in `services/www_ameide_platform/lib/onboarding-metrics.ts` to separate bootstrap funnel metrics from chat/runtime traffic.
  - All bootstrap responses now emit consistent metrics (status: `success` / `error` / `rate_limited`, HTTP status code, and duration), improving observability for abuse detection and “time to tenant reserved”.

- **Bootstrap error handling and UX**
  - Existing error mapping for tenant provisioning (`TENANT_SLUG_CONFLICT`, `TENANT_INPUT_INVALID`, transient ConnectError cases) remains in place; new rate limiting errors re-use the same logging and telemetry patterns so operators can correlate spikes in `429` with upstream capacity and abuse patterns.

**Known Gaps / Pending Work (Phase 1 and Adjacent)**

- Cluster-level verification that the **Keycloak master realm bootstrap** (`masterBootstrap`) and **ExternalSecret** wiring for `platform-app-master` are healthy and that service accounts actually hold `create-realm` + `realm-admin` in practice (not just in gitops manifests).
- Operational confirmation that the **platform service Helm releases** are enabled and stable in all target environments (dev/staging/production), including dependencies such as Postgres, Redis, and Envoy gateway.
- A dedicated **end-to-end onboarding test** that runs against a real cluster, exercising:
  - First-time login via Keycloak.
  - `/api/v1/registrations/bootstrap` → pending tenant creation and realm provisioning.
  - `/api/v1/registrations/complete` → organization + membership creation and tenant status transition to `active`.
  - Post-onboarding access to the main dashboard with the correct `tenantId` in JWT/session.

## Implementation Audit (2025-12-02)

### Audit Scope

Verified Phase 1 implementation status against requirements defined in this backlog. Audit covered:
- Frontend registration/onboarding components
- Backend API routes and rate limiting
- Identity orchestrator and tenant status transitions
- Invitation system implementation
- Keycloak admin integration
- Telemetry/metrics implementation

### Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Registration Bootstrap API | ✅ Complete | Rate limiting, telemetry, error handling implemented |
| Identity Orchestrator | ✅ Complete | Atomic org creation, status transition to ACTIVE |
| Invitation System | ✅ Complete | 7 endpoints, SHA-256 hashing, timing-safe comparison |
| Keycloak Admin | ✅ Complete | `createTenantRealm`, `invalidateAdminTokenCache` |
| Onboarding Metrics | ✅ Complete | 4 metrics tracked via OpenTelemetry |
| E2E Tests | ✅ Complete | Comprehensive Playwright coverage |
| Tenant Status Mapping | ✅ Complete | `pending_onboarding` surfaced as first-class enum |

### Remediation Completed: `pending_onboarding` Status Mapping

**Location**: [services/platform/src/tenants/service.ts](services/platform/src/tenants/service.ts), [packages/ameide_core_proto/src/ameide_core_proto/platform/v1/tenants.proto](../packages/ameide_core_proto/src/ameide_core_proto/platform/v1/tenants.proto)

**Fixes implemented**:
- Proto: Added `TENANT_STATUS_PENDING_ONBOARDING = 4` to `TenantStatus`.
- Platform service: `statusToEnum`/`statusFromEnum` map `pending_onboarding` to/from the new enum.

## 7. Temporal Workflow Design (Target State)

### State Ownership Model

> **Design Principle**: Temporal is the **source of truth** for workflow execution state. The `platform.provisioning_jobs` table is a **projection** for fast UI queries, not an authority.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    TEMPORAL VS DB STATE OWNERSHIP                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                         │
│  Temporal (Source of Truth):                                            │
│    - Workflow execution state (running, completed, failed, canceled)    │
│    - Current stage / child workflow progress                            │
│    - Signal history (email verified, payment attached, etc.)            │
│    - Retry counts, timeouts, compensation state                         │
│                                                                         │
│  platform.provisioning_jobs (Projection):                               │
│    - Last-known workflow snapshot for UI/API queries                    │
│    - Updated via activities on state changes (not direct mutation)      │
│    - May lag behind Temporal by seconds during rapid transitions        │
│    - Queries: "show me all onboardings in 'verifying' stage"            │
│                                                                         │
│  Sync Mechanism:                                                        │
│    - StateSnapshotActivity runs after each major stage transition       │
│    - Writes to provisioning_jobs with workflow_id, run_id, stage        │
│    - Idempotent (same stage update is a no-op)                          │
│    - On query, if provisioning_jobs.updated_at > 5min, check Temporal   │
│                                                                         │
│  Recovery:                                                              │
│    - If DB projection is stale, Temporal is authoritative               │
│    - Replay sync worker can rebuild projections from workflow history   │
│                                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Activity vs Workflow Separation

> **All external calls (Keycloak, Stripe, email, KYC, DB writes) are implemented as Activities, never directly inside workflow code.** This preserves Temporal's determinism guarantees.

| Type | Examples | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Workflow** (pure orchestration) | `CustomerOnboardingWorkflow`, `ProvisioningWorkflow` | No side effects, only control flow |
| **Activity** (side effects) | `createKeycloakRealm`, `sendWelcomeEmail`, `createStripeSubscription` | Retryable, timeout-bounded |
| **Signal Handler** | `EmailVerified`, `PaymentMethodAttached` | Human steps, awaited in workflow |

### Parent Workflow: CustomerOnboardingWorkflow

```typescript
export async function CustomerOnboardingWorkflow(input: OnboardingInput): Promise<OnboardingResult> {
  // 1) Lead capture & enrichment (optional CRM integration)
  const lead = await upsertLead(input);

  // 2) Identity enrollment (account + email verification)
  const identity = await executeChild(IdentityEnrollmentWorkflow, { email: input.email });

  // 3) MFA enrollment (optional based on policy)
  if (input.requireMFA) {
    await executeChild(MFAEnrollmentWorkflow, { userId: identity.userId });
  }

  // 4) B2B gates (domain verification, admin approval)
  if (input.accountType === 'B2B') {
    await executeChild(DomainVerificationWorkflow, { domain: input.companyDomain });
    await executeChild(AdminApprovalWorkflow, { userId: identity.userId });
  }

  // 5) Contract & payment (parallel)
  const [contract, payment] = await Promise.all([
    executeChild(ContractWorkflow, { userId: identity.userId, planId: input.planId }),
    executeChild(PaymentSetupWorkflow, { userId: identity.userId, planId: input.planId }),
  ]);

  // 6) Provisioning (with saga compensation)
  const provisioning = await executeChild(ProvisioningWorkflow, {
    userId: identity.userId,
    planId: input.planId,
    region: input.region,
  });

  // 7) Welcome & activation
  await executeChild(WelcomeAndActivationWorkflow, { userId: identity.userId });

  return { status: 'COMPLETED', userId: identity.userId };
}
```

### Signals (Human Steps)

- `EmailVerified(token)` - User clicked verification link
- `MFAEnrollmentCompleted(factorType)` - User enrolled MFA
- `ContractSigned(documentId)` - E-sign completed
- `PaymentMethodAttached(methodId)` - Card added
- `AdminApproved()` / `AdminRejected(reason)` - B2B gate decision
- `UserAborted(reason)` - User canceled onboarding

### Search Attributes

- `LeadId`, `Email`, `CustomerId`
- `AccountType` (B2C/B2B)
- `PlanId`, `Region`
- `LifecycleStage` (lead, verifying, provisioning, active)
- `KYCStatus`, `PaymentStatus`, `ProvisioningStatus`

```

**Onboarding Implications:**
- Realm provisioning requires `platform-app-master` service account to have `realm-admin` role
- After realm creation, must refresh admin token cache
- Realm imports are ephemeral (create-only, deleted after success)

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Onboarding Implications:**
- Onboarding wizard pages should use minimal auth (skip org context fetch and heavy session logic)
- Rely on middleware-injected headers (`x-tenant-id`, `x-user-id`, `x-org-home`) for routing decisions
- Add Redis JSON.parse error handling in session store
- Warmup Redis connection on app startup

## Appendix C: Architecture Review Summary

> **Review Date**: 2025-12-01
> **Status**: Highly aligned with vendor recommendations; key refinements applied

### Strong Alignment Areas

| Area | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| JWT + RLS tenant isolation | Matches SaaS architecture best practices |
| Invitation token security | SHA-256 hash, expiry, one-time use per vendor guidance |
| Temporal workflow design | Parent/child pattern with signals per Temporal docs |
| Transactional outbox + events | Canonical pattern for reliable event emission |
| Billing state model | Stripe subscription lifecycle correctly modeled |

### Key Refinements Applied (This Review)

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Keycloak 10k realms/cluster unrealistic | Added hybrid tenancy model: ~500 enterprise realms + shared realm for SMB |
| SCIM endpoints underspecified | Added filtering, pagination, PATCH, OAuth scope requirements |
| Identity source precedence undefined | Documented SCIM > JIT > manual invites with edge cases |
| Billing source-of-truth ambiguous | Clarified: Stripe authoritative, DB is projection via webhooks |
| Temporal vs DB state ownership | Documented: Temporal authoritative, provisioning_jobs is projection |
| MFA priority too low | Moved org owner MFA to Phase 2 (required for admin roles) |
| SCIM security controls missing | Added rate limits, anomaly detection, audit logging |

### Remaining Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Keycloak shard routing complexity | Medium | High | Start with single cluster, defer sharding until 250+ enterprise tenants |
| SCIM IdP compatibility edge cases | High | Low | Extensive conformance testing against Entra, Okta, Google |
| SMB → Enterprise realm migration | Low | Medium | Design migration workflow early, test with pilot tenants |
| Trial → payment conversion friction | Medium | Medium | A/B test payment timing, default to trial-first |

# 429 – DevContainer Bootstrap (k3d + Argo CD + GitOps)

> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED BY [435-remote-first-development.md](435-remote-first-development.md)**
>
> This document describes the **legacy local k3d bootstrap**. The project is migrating to a
> **remote-first development model** where:
> - Infrastructure code lives in `ameide-gitops` repo (not `ameide-core`)
> - DevContainer connects to shared remote AKS cluster via telepresence
> - No local k3d cluster or ArgoCD bootstrap
>
> See [435-remote-first-development.md](435-remote-first-development.md) for the new approach.

> **Related documents:**
> - [435-remote-first-development.md](435-remote-first-development.md) – **NEW**: Remote-first development architecture
> - [367-bootstrap-v2.md](367-bootstrap-v2.md) – Design document (bootstrap logic moved to ameide-gitops)
> - [432-devcontainer-modes-offline-online.md](432-devcontainer-modes-offline-online.md) – Devcontainer modes (retired - single remote mode)
> - [434-unified-environment-naming.md](434-unified-environment-naming.md) – Environment naming standardization

This document is the **implementation reference** for the devcontainer bootstrap mechanics. For design rationale and target state, see [367-bootstrap-v2.md](367-bootstrap-v2.md).

## 1. High-level goals

Opening the repo in a DevContainer should:

- Provision a **local Kubernetes cluster** (k3d) plus an internal registry.
- Install and configure **Argo CD** in a dedicated namespace.
- Register the repo’s **GitOps source** and apply the Argo projects/apps that converge the cluster to the desired state for `dev`.
- Prepare tooling for the inner-loop (**Tilt**, **kubectl**, **helm**, **argocd**, **bicep**, **yq**, Python deps).
- Expose the **Argo CD UI** on `https://localhost:8443` with a known admin credential.
- Do all of this **repeatably and idempotently**, with a **true dry-run mode** and clear **phase timing** and logs.

Everything is orchestrated via:

- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
- `.devcontainer/postCreate.sh`
- `tools/bootstrap/bootstrap-v2.sh` and its `lib/*.sh` modules
- GitOps content under `gitops/ameide-gitops/environments/dev/argocd/**`

This backlog documents the process end-to-end for contributors and for future refactors of the bootstrap pipeline.

---

## 2. Entrypoint: DevContainer lifecycle

### 2.1 devcontainer.json

File: `/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

Key points:

- Uses the repo’s `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` as the image build for VS Code / DevContainer:
  - Adds Docker-in-Docker support via `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-outside-of-docker`.
  - Adds `kubectl` and `helm` via `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/kubectl-helm-minikube`.
- Binds the host Docker socket:
  - `mounts: ["source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock,type=bind"]`
  - This is required for `k3d` to manage the cluster from inside the container.
- Injects a few **containerEnv** values from the host:
  - `PKG_GITHUB_COM_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GHCR_TOKEN`, `GHCR_USERNAME`, `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- Forwards ports:
  - `8443` – Argo CD HTTPS.
  - `10350` – Tilt UI.
- Sets `postCreateCommand` to:
  - `bash .devcontainer/postCreate.sh`

The DevContainer image is intentionally thin; the heavy lifting happens in `postCreate.sh` and `bootstrap-v2.sh`.

### 2.2 postCreate.sh

File: `/.devcontainer/postCreate.sh`

Responsibilities:

1. **Logging**:
   - All output is tee’d to `${DEVCONTAINER_BOOTSTRAP_LOG:-/home/vscode/.devcontainer-bootstrap.log}`.
   - Every line is prefixed with `[devcontainer-postCreate]`.

2. **Buf credentials**:
   - Sources `scripts/lib/buf_netrc.sh` and calls `buf_setup_netrc`.
   - Fails fast if `BUF_TOKEN` is not set in `.env`.

3. **Toolchain installation** (if missing):
   - `k3d` via upstream installer.
   - `helm` pinned to `v3.19.2` (Helm 4 is explicitly rejected due to SSA conflicts with Argo).
   - `tilt` via upstream installer.
   - `argocd` CLI from the latest Argo release.
   - `bicep` CLI based on architecture.
   - `yq` CLI.
   - Python module `pyyaml` via `pip` (user install).

4. **argocd wrapper**:
   - Writes `/home/vscode/.local/bin/argocd`:
     - Ensures the kube context is the dev cluster (`k3d-ameide` by default).
     - Reads `argocd-initial-admin-secret` from `argocd` namespace.
     - Logs into Argo CD via `argocd login` (using `--insecure` and `--grpc-web` as configured).
   - Ensures `$HOME/.local/bin` is on `PATH`.

5. **Bootstrap CLI invocation**:
   - Sets:
     - `BOOTSTRAP_CLI = tools/bootstrap/bootstrap-v2.sh`
     - `CONFIG_PATH = infra/environments/dev/bootstrap.yaml`
   - Builds `args`:
     - `--config infra/environments/dev/bootstrap.yaml`
     - `--reset-k3d`
     - `--lint-images`
     - `--lint-helm`
     - `--validate-waves`
     - `--install-argo`
     - `--apply-repo-creds`
     - `--apply-projects-ops`
     - `--apply-root-apps`
     - `--apply-dockerhub-secret`
     - `--wait-tiers`
     - `--show-admin-password`
     - `--build-images`
     - `--port-forward`
   - Logs and executes: `tools/bootstrap/bootstrap-v2.sh` with those options.

6. **Post-bootstrap dependency setup**:
   - `.devcontainer/bump-deps.sh`:
     - Bumps TS/Go/Python dependencies (go mod tidy, pnpm update, uv sync, etc.).
   - `.devcontainer/install-deps.sh`:
     - Installs workspace dependencies (`pnpm install`, `go mod download`, `uv sync`).

If **any** step fails, `postCreate.sh` logs a failure message and exits non-zero; the DevContainer creation shows this in the VS Code UI.

---

## 3. Bootstrap CLI: bootstrap-v2.sh

File: `/tools/bootstrap/bootstrap-v2.sh`

This script orchestrates all bootstrap steps. It is designed as a **single entrypoint** with:

- Strict mode: `set -Eeuo pipefail`.
- Rich error handling: `on_error` + `on_exit` traps.
- Pluggable behavior via flags and a YAML config file.
- A modular library under `tools/bootstrap/lib/*.sh`.

### 3.1 Flags and configuration

Key flags:

- `--config <file>` – Bootstrap config (`infra/environments/dev/bootstrap.yaml`).
- `--kubeconfig <path>` – Override kubeconfig file.
- `--context <name>` – Override kube context.
- `--gitops-root`, `--gitops-env` – Override GitOps directory and environment.
- `--bicep-outputs` – Bicep deployment outputs JSON.
- `--env-file` – Env file for secrets (default `.env`).
- `--wait-tier` / `--wait-tiers` – RollingSync tiers to wait for.
- `--timeout` – Timeout for tier waits (default 900s).
- `--output text|json` – Human or machine-readable summary.
- `--lint-images`, `--lint-helm`, `--validate-waves`.
- `--install-argo`, `--apply-repo-creds`, `--apply-projects-ops`, `--apply-root-apps`, `--apply-dockerhub-secret`.
- `--wait-tiers` – Wait for `<tier>-<env>` ApplicationSets.
- `--show-admin-password` – Show argocd admin password.
- `--port-forward` – Start `kubectl port-forward` for Argo.
- `--reset-k3d` – Recreate k3d cluster/registry before bootstrapping.
- `--build-images` – Build and push dev images.
- `--skip-wave-validation`, `--skip-helm-lint`.
- `--dry-run` – **Plan only; no cluster/k3d/helm/install/secret changes.**
- `--verbose`, `--debug` – More verbose logging and `set -x` in debug.

Config file: `infra/environments/dev/bootstrap.yaml`

- Controls:
  - Cluster: `context`, `type`, `name`, `registry` (`name`, `port`).
  - GitOps: `root`, `env`, `argoInstallManifest`, `rootApplication`.
  - Secrets:
    - Repo: manifest path, username env, token env.
    - DockerHub: strategy, secretName, registry, namespaces, username env, token env.
  - Bicep outputs: path to JSON.

`load_config()` uses `config_get`/`config_get_path` (from `common.sh`) to read values from YAML and fall back to sensible defaults.

### 3.2 Global behavior

- `on_error`:
  - Captures the failing command, function, and line number:
    - `[func:line] 'command' failed with exit N`.
- `on_exit`:
  - Computes total duration in seconds and `Xm Ys`.
  - If `OUTPUT_MODE=json`:
    - Prints a JSON summary:
      - `{status, cluster, argoVersion, durationSeconds, error}`.
  - Otherwise:
    - Logs:
      - `bootstrap complete for context … (argo=…, duration=Xm Ys (Ns))` or `bootstrap FAILED: <message>`.
    - Logs a **phase duration summary** if any phases executed:
      - `phase duration summary:`
      - `  - lint: 1m 14s (74s)`
      - `  - install-argo: 1m 2s (62s)`
      - etc.
    - If **not dry-run** and `--show-admin-password` was used:
      - Attempts to read `argocd-initial-admin-secret` one more time.
      - Logs a final **Argo CD admin access** block:
        - `URL: https://localhost:8443` (if port-forward is enabled).
        - `Username: admin`
        - `Password: <current admin password>` or an error if unreadable.

- Locking:
  - Uses `/tmp/bootstrap-v2.lock` to prevent concurrent runs.
  - `acquire_lock` is called at the top of `main()`.
  - `release_lock` is called from `on_exit`.

### 3.3 Phases and timing

Phases are managed by `start_phase(name)` / `end_phase()` in `common.sh`:

- On phase start:
  - Logs: `phase 'name' started`.
  - Records the start time and the order.
- On phase end:
  - Logs: `phase 'name' completed in Xm Ys (Ns)` or `... in Ns` for short phases.
  - Stores the duration in `PHASE_DURATIONS[name]`.

Typical phases for a full (non-dry-run) dev bootstrap:

1. `lint` – Image values, Helm charts, wave metadata.
2. `cluster-setup` – k3d reset, Bicep outputs, cluster readiness.
3. `build-images` (optional).
4. `install-argo` – Helm or manifest-based Argo CD install.
5. `apply-repo-creds`.
6. `show-admin-password`.
7. `apply-projects-ops`.
8. `apply-root-apps`.
9. `apply-dockerhub-secret`.
10. `wait-tiers`.
11. `port-forward`.
12. `mock-cert-export`, `mock-tilt` (if enabled).

In **dry-run**:

- Only `lint` and `cluster-steps (dry-run)` phases run.
- All cluster/helm/Argo modifications are logged as `[dry-run] would ...` and are not executed.

  - `resolve_path`, `parse_comma_list`.
- Env and config:
  - `load_env_file` – sources `.env`-style file with `set -a`.
  - `load_bicep_outputs` – loads Bicep outputs JSON into a global `BICEP_OUTPUTS` map.

### 4.2 cluster.sh

File: `tools/bootstrap/lib/cluster.sh`

Responsibilities:

- `check_kubectl_version`:
  - Probes `kubectl version --short` or falls back to full `kubectl version`.
  - Tracks if `--short` is supported via `CLUSTER_SHORT_SUPPORTED`.
- `wait_for_cluster_ready`:
  - Polls `/readyz` and `kubectl version` until both succeed or timeout (`CLUSTER_READY_TIMEOUT`, default 300s).
  - Aborts with a descriptive error on timeout.

### 4.3 k3d.sh

File: `tools/bootstrap/lib/k3d.sh`

Responsibilities:

- Cleanup helpers:
  - `cleanup_stale_docker_containers filter`.
  - `cleanup_stale_docker_network name`.
- Registry management:
  - `delete_k3d_registry_if_exists name`.
  - `create_k3d_registry name port`.
- Cluster management:
  - `delete_k3d_cluster_if_exists name`.
  - `create_k3d_cluster name registry_name registry_port`.
  - All critical calls (cluster/registry create/delete) now check exit status and log warnings on failures.
- Reset flow:
  - `maybe_reset_k3d_environment`:
    - Validates `CLUSTER_TYPE` / `TARGET_CONTEXT` are `k3d`.
    - Requires `k3d` and `docker`.
    - Deletes existing cluster/registry, then recreates them.
    - Switches kube context to `k3d-<cluster>`.
    - Waits for cluster ready via `wait_for_cluster_ready`.
- Container network access:
  - `running_inside_container` detection.
  - `ensure_k3d_container_network_access`:
    - Ensures the DevContainer is attached to the k3d Docker network (`k3d-<cluster>`).
    - Optionally updates kubeconfig cluster URL to use `k3d-<cluster>-serverlb:6443`.
  - `maybe_configure_k3d_container_access` – convenience wrapper.

### 4.4 argocd.sh

File: `tools/bootstrap/lib/argocd.sh`

Responsibilities:

- Namespace:
  - `ensure_argocd_namespace`:
    - Creates `ARGOCD_NAMESPACE` (default `argocd`) if missing.
    - Handles races where another process creates it.
- Installation:
  - `install_argo`:
    - If `ARGO_MANIFEST_PATH` is set and exists:
      - Creates namespace, applies manifest into that namespace.
      - Records version as `manifest:<filename>`.
      - Invokes `wait_for_argo_rollouts` to wait for core deployments/statefulset in parallel.
    - Else:
      - Uses `helm upgrade --install` with:
        - `--namespace "${ARGOCD_NAMESPACE}" --create-namespace`.
        - Base and env values from GitOps tree.
        - `--wait --atomic` for rollback on failure.
      - Records chart version.
    - For manifest installs, rollout failures are logged but do not hard-fail bootstrap.
- Rollout waits:
  - `wait_for_argo_rollouts`:
    - Waits for:
      - `deployment/argocd-repo-server`
      - `deployment/argocd-application-controller`
      - `deployment/argocd-server`
      - `deployment/argocd-applicationset-controller`
      - `statefulset/argocd-redis`
    - Runs all waits in parallel and logs readiness or warnings.
- Repo credentials:
  - `apply_repo_credentials`:
    - Uses `REPO_CREDENTIALS_MANIFEST` (typically `gitops/ameide-gitops/environments/dev/argocd/repos/ameide-gitops.yaml`).
    - Resolves username from `REPO_USERNAME_ENV` or `GITHUB_USERNAME` or default `git`.
    - Resolves password from `REPO_PASSWORD_ENV` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
    - Enforces that a password is present; fails with a clear error otherwise.
    - Does a targeted `envsubst` of `${ARGOCD_REPO_USERNAME} ${ARGOCD_REPO_PASSWORD}` only.
    - Applies the resulting Secret via `kubectl_argocd`.
    - Waits for `argocd-repo-server` rollout (best effort).
- Admin password:
  - `show_argocd_admin_password`:
    - Waits for `argocd-server` pods to be `Ready`.
    - Polls `argocd-initial-admin-secret` up to 150 attempts (2s interval).
    - If `ARGOCD_PASSWORD_FILE` is set:
      - Writes the password there with mode 600 and logs the path.
    - Else, if stdout is a TTY:
      - Prints a framed block with the password.
    - Else:
      - Logs a warning and suppresses password output (so CI logs are not contaminated).

### 4.5 gitops.sh

File: `tools/bootstrap/lib/gitops.sh`

Responsibilities:

- Small wrappers:
  - `apply_directory_if_exists path` – recursive apply for a directory or single-file apply for a file, with logging.
  - `apply_yaml_file` – logs and applies a single manifest.
  - `has_kustomization` – detects kustomization in a directory.
  - `apply_kustomization_dir` – applies a kustomization directory.
- Projects and ops:
  - `apply_projects_and_ops`:
    - Applies all `project-*.yaml` manifests under `${GITOPS_ARGO_DIR}`.
    - Applies the `ops` directory (if present) recursively.
- Root applications:
  - `apply_root_applications`:
    - If `ROOT_APPLICATION_PATH` is a single file: apply it.
    - If a directory:
      - If it is a kustomization: apply via `-k`.
      - Else:
        - Apply all `*.yaml` / `*.yml` files.
        - Apply any subdirectories that contain kustomizations.
      - Logs if nothing was applied.

### 4.6 secrets.sh

File: `tools/bootstrap/lib/secrets.sh`

Responsibilities:

- `apply_dockerhub_secret`:
  - Strategy `env`:
    - Uses `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME_ENV` / `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN_ENV`.
    - Defaults namespaces to `["ameide"]` if none are configured.
    - For each namespace:
      - Ensures the namespace exists (creates if needed).
      - Creates/updates the Docker registry secret via `--dry-run=client | kubectl apply`.
    - Performs the work in **parallel** for all namespaces and logs per-namespace success/failure.
  - Strategies `skip`, `managed-identity`:
    - Logs that DockerHub secrets are skipped.
  - Unknown strategies:
    - Logs an error and returns non-zero.

### 4.7 status.sh

File: `tools/bootstrap/lib/status.sh`

Responsibilities:

- Waiting for ApplicationSet tiers:
  - `wait_for_single_tier appset_name`:
    - Waits for `.status.conditions` to report `ResourcesUpToDate=True`.
    - Then fetches all associated `Application` objects, checks:
      - `status.health.status == Healthy`
      - `status.sync.status == Synced`
    - Logs warnings for any app not Healthy/Synced and fails the tier.
  - `wait_for_tiers`:
    - Runs `wait_for_single_tier` in **parallel** for all tiers in `WAIT_TIERS`.
    - Logs per-tier success/failure and returns non-zero if any tier fails.

### 4.8 portforward.sh

File: `tools/bootstrap/lib/portforward.sh`

Responsibilities:

- Readiness:
  - `ensure_argocd_server_ready`:
    - Waits for `argocd-server` pods in `ARGOCD_NAMESPACE` to be Ready.
    - Uses `ARGOCD_SERVER_WAIT_TIMEOUT` (default 120s).
- Port forwards:
  - `start_port_forward_instance name local_port remote_port address pid_file log_file`:
    - Stops any existing forward tracked by `pid_file`.
    - Attempts up to three starts:
      - `kubectl port-forward svc/${ARGOCD_SERVER_SERVICE_NAME} --address ${address} ${local_port}:${remote_port}`.
    - Logs PID and log file location on success; logs a failure message after 3 attempts.
  - `start_argocd_port_forwards`:
    - For `dev`, when `ARGOCD_PORT_FORWARD_ADDRESS` is unset:
      - Uses `0.0.0.0:8443 -> svc/argocd-server:443`.
    - Otherwise:
      - Uses `address:8080 -> 443`.

---

## 5. Dry-run semantics

When `--dry-run` is specified:

- Lint phase:
  - `lint-image-values` **does run** (local, safe).
  - `lint-helm` is **skipped**:
    - Logs: `[dry-run] skipping helm lint (would add/update Helm repos and download chart dependencies)`.
  - `validate-waves` **does run** (local `python3` script).
- Cluster phase:
  - No `kubectl`, `k3d`, `helm`, secrets, or port-forward invocations run.
  - Instead, `cluster-steps (dry-run)` logs everything that would happen:
    - `would reset k3d environment`, `would build/push dev images`, `would install/upgrade Argo CD`, etc.
- `on_exit` still:
  - Logs total duration and phase summary.
  - **Skips** the final Argo admin access block.

The invariant: in dry-run, **no external state** is changed (no Helm repo updates, no cluster changes, no secrets applied).

---

## 6. Argo CD admin access summary

On a successful, non-dry-run bootstrap with `--show-admin-password`:

- `show_argocd_admin_password` logs the password during bootstrap (subject to TTY rules).
- `on_exit` repeats a summarized view:

```text
[bootstrap-v2] Argo CD admin access:
[bootstrap-v2]   URL: https://localhost:8443
[bootstrap-v2]   Username: admin
[bootstrap-v2]   Password: <current_password_or_error>
```

Implementation details:

- If `--port-forward` is used:
  - URL is `https://localhost:8443`.
- Otherwise:
  - URL is a placeholder, assuming the in-cluster service endpoint.
- Password retrieval:
  - `kubectl_argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d`.

This makes it easy for a developer to copy-paste the Argo CD URL and credentials from the end of the bootstrap log.

---

## 7. Future improvements (notes)

Potential follow-ups:

- Extract a dedicated `parallel.sh` or "worker pool" module for bounded concurrency across lint, tier waits, and secret creation.
- Add JSON-structured phase timing output for `--output json` to feed CI dashboards.
- Provide a `--no-lint` flag for faster iterative bootstraps in trusted local environments.
- Extend dry-run to optionally simulate tier readiness/health by inspecting current cluster state without requiring Argo to be installed.
- Document and standardize environment variables controlling namespace, port-forward address, and password output location for multi-dev setups (e.g., `ARGOCD_NAMESPACE`, `ARGOCD_SERVER_SERVICE_NAME`, `ARGOCD_PASSWORD_FILE`).

## 8. Integration with other backlogs

### Telepresence mode ([432](432-devcontainer-modes-offline-online.md), [434](434-unified-environment-naming.md))

`online-telepresence` now loads `infra/environments/dev/bootstrap-telepresence.yaml`, persists the mode in `~/.devcontainer-mode.env`, sets `DEV_REMOTE_CONTEXT`/`TILT_REMOTE=1`, installs the Telepresence CLI, and invokes `tools/dev/telepresence.sh connect --context ameide-staging --namespace ameide-staging` when `autoConnect` is enabled. Tilt uses those env vars to push images to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/ameideio/...`) and restricts kube contexts to the AKS staging namespace. See [docs/dev-workflows/telepresence.md](../docs/dev-workflows/telepresence.md) for the end-to-end workflow.

### Domain rename ([434](434-unified-environment-naming.md))

The domain rename from `tilt.ameide.io` → `local.ameide.io` is complete. Gateway listeners, cert-manager SANs, and the Tilt-only Helm values all reference `*.local.ameide.io`; host-level dnsmasq helpers were removed now that we rely on the remote AKS cluster + Telepresence. See [367-bootstrap-v2.md](367-bootstrap-v2.md#38-domain-naming) for the authoritative list.

### Remote AKS bootstrap ([367](367-bootstrap-v2.md))

Before bootstrap-v2 can target AKS clusters, the remote GitOps structure must be migrated from the legacy path (`ameide.git/infra/kubernetes/gitops/`) to `ameide-gitops`. See [434-unified-environment-naming.md](434-unified-environment-naming.md#migration-needed) for migration tasks.

### Build-Only Components

- `ameide_core_proto` has been removed from the integration suite roster. The Buf bundle now builds via `packages/ameide_core_proto/scripts/build_artifacts.sh` and no longer reports a faux dual-mode test. This keeps the integration metrics scoped to suites that exercise application behavior rather than code generation.

---

## Detailed Gaps by Service

### `platform` (P1)

**Status:** Compliant

**Notes:**
- `run_integration_tests.sh` runs full suite in both modes (no filtering)
- Cross-service test now dual-mode via mock clients; mock-mode run passes

---

### `graph` (P1)

**Status:** Compliant

**Notes:**
- Mode-aware handlers in helpers select mock vs. live graph service
- Mock mode passes without DB envs

---

### `www_ameide_platform` (P1)

**Status:** Compliant

**Notes:**
- Jest integration config now exercises the full suite in both modes; `getServerClient()` automatically routes to the mock transport when `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE=mock`.
- Added a hardened `pnpm dev:mock` entry point plus Playwright webServer orchestration so mock-mode E2E runs bootstrap a Next dev server with MSW interceptors and seeded fixtures.
- `tests/scripts/run-playwright-e2e.mjs` enforces the mode contract (defaulting to mock), injects deterministic credentials, and fail-fast validates base URLs per backlog 430.

---

### `repository` (P2)

**Status:** Compliant

**Notes:**
- `services/repository/__mocks__` exposes mock handlers plus fixture seeding so the entire metamodel stack runs in memory when `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE=mock`.
- `createIntegrationHarness()` (helpers.ts) loads the same test cases in both modes by swapping the backing handlers/client only.
- Runner validates database env vars only when `MODE=cluster`, so local developers default to mock mode safely.

---

### `threads` (P2)

**Status:** Compliant

**Notes:**
- Added `services/threads/__mocks__/` with mock transport + fixtures
- Integration helpers now create mode-aware clients for append/send flows
- Runner supports mock + cluster modes with strict env validation
- Mock-mode suite passes without external services

---

### `chat` (P2)

**Status:** Compliant

**Notes:**
- `createThreadsClient()` pulls from `chat/__mocks__` whenever the mode helper returns `mock`, exposing the same API surface as the production gRPC service.
- Runner only enforces `CHAT_SERVICE_URL` et al in cluster mode; mock mode works with zero external dependencies.
- Fixtures ensure deterministic IDs, so the assertions in `threads.integration.test.ts` execute identically in both modes.

---

### `inference` (P2)

**Status:** Compliant

**Notes:**
- Added mock FastAPI + gRPC layer under `services/inference/__mocks__/` with fixtures and downstream service doubles.
- Integration helpers/conftest provide shared dual-mode clients; assertions run identically in mock/cluster.
- `run_integration_tests.sh` now defaults to mock mode and validates cluster env vars; mock suite passes.

---

### `agents_runtime` (P2)

**Status:** Compliant

**Notes:**
- `services/agents_runtime/__mocks__` ships a full gRPC twin (agents + runtime services) plus MinIO stubs; pytest fixtures spin it up when `integration_mode()` resolves to `mock`.
- Runner enforces the MinIO + GRPC env vars only for cluster, while mock mode dumps structured log output and proceeds with in-memory transports.
- Tests share helpers that return mode-aware SDK clients, so the same assertions cover both transports without branching.

---

### `workflows_runtime` (P2)

**Status:** Compliant

**Notes:**
- `services/workflows_runtime/__mocks__/temporal.py` exposes `run_mock_platform_workflow`, letting the pytest helpers execute the Temporal workflows entirely in-process when `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE=mock`.
- Cluster mode still verifies Temporal env vars and exercises the real worker via `Client.connect()`, but the test harness is identical.
- Runner emits the structured start log and only fails fast when cluster env vars are missing.

---

### `transformation` (P3)

**Status:** Compliant

**Notes:**
- The integration harness swaps between `createMockTransformationClient()` and the live service via `getServerClient()` based on `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE`, ensuring single implementation / dual execution.
- Runner enforces database env vars only when `MODE=cluster`, so the default (`mock`) requires no backing Postgres.
- `services/transformation/__mocks__` contains typed fixtures plus handler reset utilities to keep tests deterministic.

---

### `workflow_worker` (P3)

**Status:** Compliant

**Notes:**
- Added `services/workflow_worker/__mocks__/temporal.py` plus shared helpers so Temporal workflows can execute entirely in-memory during mock runs while still capturing status updates.
- `run_integration_tests.sh` validates `TEMPORAL_*` env vars in cluster mode, emits structured logs, and defaults to mock mode for local developers.
- Integration tests rely on a single implementation that now switches transports via `run_platform_workflow`, keeping assertions identical in both modes.

---

### `ameide_sdk_go` (P2)

**Status:** Compliant

**Notes:**
- `TestGraphDualModeContract` now builds a `contractEnv` that instantiates either the mock server or the live cluster client while running the same assertions, so both transports exercise the identical repository contract.
- Runner enforces the dual-mode env contract and emits the structured start log; no transitional shims remain.
- Follow-up work shifts to broadening coverage (additional RPCs) rather than dual-mode plumbing.

---

## E2E Test Status

### Current State

| Feature | Spec Files | Mock Mode | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `auth` | 2 | **Yes** | Dual-mode |
| `navigation` | 5 | **Yes** | Dual-mode |
| `graphs` | 1 | **Yes** | Dual-mode |
| `onboarding` | 2 | **Yes** | Dual-mode |
| `invitations` | 1 | **Yes** | Dual-mode |

### Violations

1. **None** - Playwright now honors `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE` and boots a mock dev server when requested.

### Required Work

- [x] Add MSW to dev server for mock mode
- [x] Create `pnpm dev:mock` script
- [x] Configure Playwright to use mock dev server
- [x] Create mock fixtures for all E2E scenarios
- [x] Ensure E2E tests pass without cluster

---

## `__mocks__/` Directory Status

### Existing (15 services)

| Service | Files | Quality |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `platform` | `index.ts`, `client.ts` | Good - full mock client |
| `graph` | `service.ts` | Good - mock handlers |
| `threads` | `client.ts`, `fixtures.ts`, `index.ts` | Good - mock transport |
| `www_ameide_platform` | `handlers.ts`, `next/`, `http.ts` | Full MSW + mock fetch stack |
| `agents` | `server.go` | Mock gRPC server (Go) |
| `inference_gateway` | `inference.go` | Mock inference backend (Go) |
| `inference` | `fixtures.py`, `http.py`, `grpc.py`, `websocket.py` | Dual-mode mock FastAPI + gRPC |
| `workflow_worker` | `temporal.py` | Temporal-free workflow harness |
| `repository` | `client.ts`, `fixtures.ts`, `index.ts` | Mock metamodel + repo services |
| `chat` | `client.ts`, `fixtures.ts` | Full ThreadsService mock transport |
| `transformation` | `client.ts`, `handlers.ts` | Mock client + service handlers |
| `agents_runtime` | `grpc.py`, `clients.py`, `fixtures.py` | Mock agents + runtime servers |
| `workflows` | `client.ts`, `fixtures.ts` | Workflows gRPC mock |
| `workflows_runtime` | `temporal.py`, `fixtures.py` | Mock Temporal harness |
| `www_ameide` | `index.ts`, `http.ts`, `fixtures.ts` | Mock fetch + server handlers |

### Missing

None. Every service-level integration suite now has a co-located `__mocks__/` directory.

---

## Runner Script Compliance

### Compliant Patterns (Good)

All 18 active runners:
- Source `tools/integration-runner/integration-mode.sh`
- Source `tools/integration-runner/junit-path.sh`
- Export `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE`
- Emit structured JSON log

### Non-Compliant Patterns (Fix Required)

None. All runners follow the five-step contract from backlog 430.

## 430-unified-test-infrastructure.md

---
title: 430 – Unified Test Infrastructure
status: active
owners:
  - platform
  - test-infra
created: 2025-12-01
updated: 2025-12-02
supersedes:
  - 371-e2e-playwright.md
  - 376-integration-test-dual-modes.md
---

## Summary

This backlog defines the **target state** for all automated tests in the codebase. It consolidates and supersedes backlogs 371 and 376.

**This document describes the end state only.** Transitional patterns, backward compatibility shims, fallbacks, and workarounds are explicitly forbidden. All implementations must conform to the target architecture.

> ⚠️ **Remote-first reminder:** Wherever this backlog mentions a “cluster” profile or k3d-based execution, substitute the shared AKS namespace (`ameide-dev`) reached via Telepresence per [435-remote-first-development.md](435-remote-first-development.md).

### Cluster + image authority model

- **Single Argo CD control plane:** A single Argo deployment in the `argocd` namespace reconciles every environment namespace (`ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod`) using Projects for logical boundaries rather than multiple controllers.
- **GitHub as source-of-truth:** `ameide-gitops` defines the image repository/tag per environment; CI publishes artifacts to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) and updates GitOps values. Tests must never override images outside Git.
- **Tilt + Telepresence only for inner loop:** Cluster test profiles run against the Argo baseline in AKS. Tilt-only releases (`*-tilt`) continue to exist for developer workflows but are not part of the unified test contract.

---

## Non-Negotiable Principles

### 1. Two Modes, No Exceptions

Every test suite supports exactly two modes:

| Mode | Environment | Dependencies |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `mock` | Local, DevContainer, CI pre-merge | In-memory stubs only |
| `cluster` | AKS (`ameide-dev` namespace for dev profiles, staging/prod clusters in CI) | Real Kubernetes services |

**Forbidden:**
- Hybrid modes ("partial mock")
- Environment-specific branches other than mock/cluster
- Conditional skips based on mode
- Graceful degradation when dependencies missing

### 2. Single Implementation, Dual Execution

Each test has **one implementation** that runs in both modes:

```typescript
// Target pattern
const client = mode === 'cluster'
  ? createLiveClient(requireEnv('GRPC_ADDRESS'))
  : createMockClient(fixtures);

it('lists repositories', async () => {
  const repos = await client.listRepositories();
  expect(repos.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

**Forbidden:**
- Separate test files for mock vs cluster
- `test.skip.if(mode === 'mock')`
- Different assertions per mode
- `JEST_EXTRA_ARGS` to filter tests by mode (transitional only)

### 3. Fail Fast, Always

| Scenario | Required Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Missing env var (cluster mode) | **Exit 1** with clear message |
| Missing fixture (mock mode) | **Exit 1** with clear message |
| Unknown mode value | **Exit 1** at startup |
| External service unavailable | **Fail test** (not skip) |

**Forbidden:**
- Silent skips
- Default/fallback env var values in cluster mode
- `try/catch` that swallows missing dependencies
- Empty test suites that "pass" with no assertions

### 4. Language Alignment

| Test Type | Language | Framework |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Integration | Same as service | Jest (TS), pytest (Python), go test (Go) |
| E2E | TypeScript only | Playwright only |

**Forbidden:**
- Cypress, Selenium, or other E2E frameworks
- Python/Go E2E tests
- Integration tests in different language than service

### 5. Canonical Folder Structure

```
services/<service>/
  __mocks__/                    # Mock implementations (required)
    index.ts                    # Public API
    client.ts                   # Mock client factory
    fixtures.ts                 # Typed fixture data
  __tests__/
    unit/                       # Pure unit tests
    integration/                # Dual-mode tests
      run_integration_tests.sh  # Entry point (required)
      helpers.ts                # Mode-aware factories
      *.test.ts
```

**Forbidden:**
- Mocks scattered in test files
- Missing `__mocks__/` directory for services with integration tests
- `__tests__/integration/` without `run_integration_tests.sh`
- Fixture data inline in tests

---

## Mode Contract

### Environment Variable

```bash
INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE=mock|cluster
```

**Rules:**
- Default: `mock` (safe for local development)
- Unknown values: **Exit 1** (never fallback)
- Case-insensitive: `MOCK`, `Mock`, `mock` all valid

### Runner Script Contract

Every `run_integration_tests.sh` must:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# 1. Source mode helper (required)
source "tools/integration-runner/integration-mode.sh"

# 2. Resolve and export mode (required)
MODE="$(integration_mode)"
export INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE="${MODE}"

# 3. Mode-specific setup (required)
if [[ "${MODE}" == "mock" ]]; then
  # Mock mode: no env var requirements
  echo "[service] INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE=mock"
else
  # Cluster mode: validate required env vars
  require_cluster_mode "${MODE}"
  for var in GRPC_ADDRESS DATABASE_URL; do
    [[ -z "${!var:-}" ]] && { echo "${var} required"; exit 1; }
  done
fi

# 4. Emit structured log (required)
printf '%s\n' '{"event":"integration_test_started","mode":"'"${MODE}"'"}'

# 5. Source JUnit helper and run tests
source "tools/integration-runner/junit-path.sh"
JUNIT_PATH="$(resolve_junit_path service-name)"
```

---

## Mock Layer Architecture

### Structure

```
services/<service>/
  __mocks__/
    index.ts         # export { createMockClient, fixtures }
    client.ts        # createMockClient() implementation
    fixtures.ts      # typed fixture data
    handlers.ts      # MSW handlers (if HTTP service)
```

### gRPC Mock Pattern (TypeScript)

```typescript
// __mocks__/client.ts
import { createRouterTransport } from '@connectrpc/connect';
import { Service } from '@ameide/core-proto';
import { fixtures } from './fixtures';

export function createMockTransport() {
  return createRouterTransport(({ service }) => {
    service(Service, {
      list: () => fixtures.items,
      get: (req) => {
        const item = fixtures.items.find(i => i.id === req.id);
        if (!item) throw new ConnectError('Not found', Code.NotFound);
        return item;
      },
    });
  });
}
```

### Fixture Pattern

```typescript
// __mocks__/fixtures.ts
import { Item, ItemStatus } from '@ameide/core-proto';

export const fixtures = {
  items: [
    { id: 'item-001', name: 'Test', status: ItemStatus.ACTIVE },
  ] satisfies Item[],

  empty: { items: [] },

  errors: {
    notFound: { id: 'does-not-exist' },
  },
};
```

### Client Factory Pattern

```typescript
// __tests__/integration/helpers.ts
import { getIntegrationMode, requireEnv } from 'tools/integration-runner/ts/mode';
import { createMockTransport } from '../../__mocks__';
import { createConnectTransport } from '@connectrpc/connect-node';

export function createClient() {
  const mode = getIntegrationMode();

  return mode === 'cluster'
    ? createConnectTransport({ baseUrl: requireEnv('GRPC_ADDRESS') })
    : createMockTransport();
}
```

## E2E Tests

### Location

```
services/www_ameide_platform/
  features/<feature>/
    __tests__/
      e2e/
        *.spec.ts
```

### Mock Mode (Target State)

E2E tests in mock mode use MSW to intercept API calls:

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  webServer: {
    command: process.env.INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE === 'mock'
      ? 'pnpm dev:mock'    // MSW-enabled dev server
      : undefined,         // Cluster deployment
  },
});
```

## Artifacts

### JUnit Output

All tests emit JUnit XML:

```bash
source tools/integration-runner/junit-path.sh
JUNIT_PATH="$(resolve_junit_path service-name)"
# → /artifacts/service-name/junit.xml
```

## Forbidden Patterns

### Transitional Shims (Remove All)

| Pattern | Why Forbidden |
|---------|---------------|
| `JEST_EXTRA_ARGS` test filtering by mode | Tests must run same in both modes |
| `${VAR:-default}` in cluster mode | Cluster must require all vars |
| `resolve_junit_path()` inline fallback | Use helper consistently |
| Multiple URL env var checks | Single canonical var per service |

### Legacy Env Vars (Never Use)

| Variable | Replacement |
|----------|-------------|
| `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS` | `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE=cluster` |
| `*_USE_LIVE_DB` | `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE=cluster` |
| `*_INTEGRATION_ENABLED` | `INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE=cluster` |
| `SKIP_*_TESTS` | Remove; fail if dependencies missing |

### Anti-Patterns

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN: Conditional skip
test.skipIf(mode === 'mock')('requires cluster', () => {});

// FORBIDDEN: Different behavior per mode
const expected = mode === 'mock' ? 'mock-response' : 'real-response';

// FORBIDDEN: Swallowing errors
try { await client.call(); } catch { /* ignore in mock */ }

// FORBIDDEN: Empty test file
describe('cluster-only tests', () => {
  // nothing runs in mock mode
});
```

---

## Observability

### Structured Logging

Every test run emits:

```json
{
  "event": "integration_test_started",
  "service": "platform",
  "mode": "cluster",
  "env": {
    "INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE": "cluster",
    "GRPC_ADDRESS": "envoy.ameide.svc:443"
  }
}
```

### Metrics

| Metric | Labels |
|--------|--------|
| `integration_test_duration_seconds` | `service`, `mode`, `result` |
| `integration_test_result_total` | `service`, `mode`, `result` |

---

## Cross-References

| Backlog | Relationship |

## 431-auth-session-v2.md

# 431 – Auth & Session Architecture v2 (Middleware-First)

**Status:** Adopted  
**Intent:** Define the canonical pattern for authentication and session usage in the Ameide Platform after `safeAuth` removal. This backlog consolidates decisions from:
- [329-auth.md](./329-auth.md)
- [331-tenant-resolution.md](./331-tenant-resolution.md)
- [330-dynamic-tenant-resolution.md](./330-dynamic-tenant-resolution.md)
- [427-platform-login-stability.md](./427-platform-login-stability.md)
- [428-onboarding.md](./428-onboarding.md)

and replaces the older “server components call `safeAuth()`” model with a **middleware-first** architecture.

---

## 1. Motivation

We previously relied on `safeAuth()` for server-side session access in layouts, server components, and some utilities:

- RootLayout called `safeAuth()`, causing Redis and org-fetch work on every SSR request.
- Server utilities (e.g. `org-scope`, feature resolvers) could also trigger `safeAuth()`.
- This made `/login` and other routes fragile (connection resets, long compilation times).

Backlog [427](./427-platform-login-stability.md) implemented a safer pattern:

- Edge middleware (proxy) validates the session once and injects trusted headers.
- Public routes (like `/login`) no longer perform server-side auth.
- `safeAuth` has been removed from the codebase.

This backlog captures that **v2 auth/session architecture** so future work stays aligned.

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture

### 2.1 Flow Overview

```text
Keycloak (tenantId user attribute)
  ↓
JWT Token (tenantId + roles claims via protocol mappers)
  ↓
NextAuth Session (session.user.tenantId, roles, org context)
  ↓
Proxy Auth Gate (`proxy.ts`, using an edge-compatible NextAuth config, running in the Node runtime)
  ↓
Trusted headers for server components:
  - x-pathname
  - x-tenant-id
  - x-user-id
  - x-user-kc-sub
  - x-org-home
  ↓
App Routes
  - Public: (public)/login, (public)/register, healthz
  - Authenticated: (app)/..., (onboarding)/...
  - API routes: use getSession() only when strictly needed
```

### 2.2 Runtimes and Responsibilities

- **Proxy Auth Gate (`services/www_ameide_platform/proxy.ts`):**
  - Runs in the **Node runtime**, using an **edge-compatible** NextAuth configuration (JWT sessions, no DB adapter) to validate cookies and decode the session token.
  - Enforces optimistic access control for protected routes (redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` with `callbackUrl` and applies onboarding rules like `hasRealOrganization` → `/onboarding`).
  - Injects `x-pathname`, `x-tenant-id`, `x-user-id`, `x-user-kc-sub`, `x-org-home` for downstream server components and layouts.
  - Does **not** perform Redis or org-fetch operations; all heavy/authoritative checks happen in Node-only API routes and backend services.

- **Root Layout (`app/layout.tsx`):**
  - Performs **no server-side auth or session lookup**.
  - Hydrates global providers with `session = null`.
  - Delegates auth state to:
    - Middleware-injected headers for server components.
    - Client-side session hooks in the browser.

- **Public Layout / Routes (`app/(public)/...`):**
  - `PublicLayout` performs no auth() / `getSession()` calls.
  - `/login` is a client-only page that:
    - Sanitizes `callbackUrl` and `realm` params.
    - Prepares a secure redirect to `/api/auth/signin/keycloak`.
  - `/register` is implemented as an HTML-only route that forwards into Auth.js/Keycloak.
  - `/healthz` is a standalone route (`dynamic = 'force-static'`), excluded from middleware.

- **Authenticated App Routes (`app/(app)/...`, `app/(onboarding)/...`):**
  - Assume middleware has already enforced auth and onboarding rules.
  - Use headers:
    - `x-pathname` to resolve navigation descriptors.
    - `x-tenant-id`, `x-user-id`, `x-user-kc-sub`, `x-org-home` for org/tenant context.
  - Must **not** call `auth()` / `getSession()` in layouts for gating.

> **Security note:** The middleware-injected headers are a **convenience mechanism** for layouts and server components, not a security boundary. All sensitive operations (e.g. tenant/org membership, role checks, data reads/writes) must still be enforced in Node-only API routes and backend services using authenticated session/JWT context.

---

## 3. Allowed Session Access Patterns

### 3.1 Preferred: Middleware Headers

Server components and layouts should preferentially use headers injected by middleware:

- `x-tenant-id` – primary tenant identifier.
- `x-user-id` / `x-user-kc-sub` – user identity, realm-aware.
- `x-org-home` – resolved home org route for the current user.
- `x-pathname` – canonical request pathname for navigation.

Examples:

- `app/(app)/layout.tsx`:
  - Reads `x-pathname`, `x-tenant-id` and calls `getNavigationDescriptor(pathname, tenantId)`.
- `app/(app)/org/[orgId]/layout.tsx`:
  - Reads `x-tenant-id`, `x-user-id`, `x-user-kc-sub` to resolve the organization via gRPC.

**Rule:** If the information you need is already in headers, do not call `getSession()`.

### 3.2 Direct `getSession()` (Node runtime only)

Direct calls to `getSession()` from `app/(auth)/auth.ts` are allowed in **narrow, explicit contexts**:

- **Navigation access control**:
  - `features/navigation/server/access.ts` uses `getSession()` to:
    - Read roles (`admin`, `contributor`, `viewer`, etc.).
    - Compute `UserAccess` booleans for navigation.
- **Debug and test endpoints** (guarded by env flags):
  - `/api/auth/debug` – surfaces session and token wiring details.
  - `/api/test/userinfo` – demonstrates use of access tokens against Keycloak.

**Constraints for `getSession()` usage:**

- Node runtime only (`runtime = 'nodejs'`).
- Never in:
  - Root layout.
  - Public routes.
  - Health checks.
  - General-purpose server components that can leverage headers instead.

### 3.3 Disallowed: New Auth Helpers

The following patterns are **not allowed** going forward:

- Reintroducing `safeAuth()` or any wrapper around `auth()` / `getSession()` that:
  - Hides JWT/Redis exceptions.
  - Encourages implicit session access from arbitrary server components.
- Calling `auth()` / `getSession()` from:
  - `app/layout.tsx`.
  - `(public)` layout and routes.
  - `(app)` layout for gating basic navigation.

---

## 4. safeAuth Deprecation (Final)

### 4.1 Historical Role

`safeAuth()` was introduced as a Node-only helper that:

- Wrapped NextAuth `auth()` / `getSession()`.
- Swallowed JWT/JWE decode/verify errors and returned `null`.
- Prevented crashes when stale/invalid cookies or secret mismatches occurred.

It was used by:

- RootLayout for server-side session resolution.
- Some server utilities (`org-scope`, feature helpers).
- Debug and test routes.

### 4.2 Current Status

As of the work captured in [427](./427-platform-login-stability.md):

- `safeAuth` has been **fully removed** from the codebase.
- `app/(auth)/safe-auth.ts` no longer exists.
- All prior call sites have been migrated to either:
  - Middleware header consumption, or
  - Explicit `getSession()` calls in Node-only, tightly scoped modules.

Any remaining references to `safeAuth` in backlog documents are:

- Annotated as **historical**.
- Accompanied by notes pointing to this v2 architecture.

**Rule:** Do not reintroduce `safeAuth` or similar “catch-all” auth helpers.

---

## 5. Patterns for New Work

### 5.1 New Public Routes (e.g. marketing, auth entry points)

When adding routes under `app/(public)/`:

- Use `PublicLayout` or another non-auth layout.
- Do **not** import `auth()`, `getSession()`, or any auth helper.
- If a route needs to kick off an OAuth flow:
  - Prepare safe redirect URLs client-side (like `/login`).
  - Call into `/api/auth/signin` or provider-specific Auth.js endpoints.

Public routes should never block on Redis or org-fetch logic.

### 5.2 New Authenticated Pages

For new routes under `app/(app)/` or `app/(onboarding)/`:

- Assume middleware has gated access.
- Use:
  - `x-tenant-id` to parameterize SDK clients and RPC calls.
  - `x-user-id` / `x-user-kc-sub` for user- or org-specific data fetches.
- Avoid calling `getSession()` unless:
  - You need detailed session fields that are not represented in headers (and those fields cannot reasonably be added to middleware headers).

If you find yourself needing session fields frequently, consider extending middleware and header wiring rather than adding more `getSession()` usage.

### 5.3 New API Routes

API routes may:

- Use `getSession()` from `app/(auth)/auth.ts` to:
  - Verify authentication.
  - Read tenant and role information.
- Optionally trust middleware headers where appropriate (e.g. behind internal proxies).

However:

- Do not introduce new `safeAuth`-like wrappers.
- Prefer explicit error handling around `getSession()` and token refresh flows.

---

## 6. Migration Checklist for Legacy Code

When touching legacy code that still mentions `safeAuth` in backlogs or comments:

1. **Identify usage pattern:**
   - Is it a layout/page/server component?
   - Is it a helper or API route?
2. **Replace with headers when possible:**
   - For layouts and server components, use `headers()` and the middleware-injected headers.
3. **Otherwise use `getSession()` directly:**
   - For Node-only API routes and targeted helpers.
4. **Update documentation:**
   - Mark `safeAuth` references as historical and point to this backlog.
5. **Verify behavior:**
   - `/login` and `/healthz` must not regress (no Redis/org fetch).
   - Authenticated routes continue to respect tenant/org boundaries.

> - Infrastructure code moved to `ameide-gitops` repo
>
> See [435-remote-first-development.md](435-remote-first-development.md) for the new approach.

## Update – Minimal profile retired
- **2025-12-02:** The profile-based "offline-minimal" experiment has been removed. Maintaining two GitOps projections bloated chart logic, left Argo in `Unknown`/`Degraded` states when services were intentionally absent, and added cognitive load to the DevContainer. The codebase now ships a single offline profile (full stack) plus the online/telepresence workflow.
- Cleanup steps completed in this change:
  - Deleted `infra/environments/dev/bootstrap-minimal.yaml`, `gitops/.../argocd/profiles/minimal/**/*`, and `gitops/.../sources/values/profile/minimal/**/*`.
  - Simplified `.devcontainer/postCreate.sh` and `tools/dev/devcontainer-mode.sh` so the only local bootstrap path is `offline-full` (k3d + Argo). Telepresence mode still bypasses local bootstrap entirely.
  - Removed profile-aware logic from `gitops/ameide-gitops/environments/dev/argocd/apps/ameide.yaml`; every Application now renders from shared + env-specific values, eliminating empty templating and ApplicationSet skips.

## Goals
- Give contributors a predictable k3d-based DevContainer that provisions the full dev stack (Argo, GitOps apps, local registry, waits, and image builds) without special casing subsets.
- Support an "online-telepresence" workflow that skips local cluster bootstrap, assumes a healthy remote AKS dev cluster, and lets Tilt/Telepresence target that context for rapid service iteration.
- Preserve the `*-tilt` split so locally-built services never fight Argo reconciliation, regardless of mode.

## Implementation Status: ✅ Offline full + Online telepresence
- Offline bootstrap always uses `infra/environments/dev/bootstrap.yaml`. There is no longer a `profile` dimension or Kustomize overlay that prunes Applications.
- Telepresence mode remains opt-in; it just reuses the remote context wiring added previously and does not reintroduce the minimal profile.

### Architecture Overview

         └── All Applications render with shared + env values
```

### Key Files Updated
| Component | File | Change |
|-----------|------|--------|
| DevContainer | `.devcontainer/postCreate.sh` | Mode dispatcher only supports `offline-full` and `online-telepresence`; default mode is now `offline-full`.
| DevContainer toggle | `tools/dev/devcontainer-mode.sh` | Reapply script now just re-runs the full bootstrap (minimal mode removed).
| GitOps ApplicationSet | `gitops/ameide-gitops/environments/dev/argocd/apps/ameide.yaml` | Deleted profile-specific value files and the third-party skip list; Helm releases always read `_shared` + env overlays.
| GitOps values & overlays | `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/values/profile/` | Directory removed; charts rely solely on `_shared`, `dev`, or Tilt/local overlays.

## Target modes
### Offline-full
- Applies the full GitOps tree via `bootstrap-v2.sh` (install Argo, projects, root apps, secrets, waits, port-forwards, and dev image builds).
- Runs in the DevContainer by default (`.devcontainer/postCreate.sh` without args).

### Online-telepresence
- Loads `infra/environments/dev/bootstrap-telepresence.yaml`, persists the mode in `~/.devcontainer-mode.env`, and switches `kubectl` to the remote AKS context (`ameide-stg-aks`).
- Installs the Telepresence CLI and calls `tools/dev/telepresence.sh connect --context <ctx> --namespace ameide` when `autoConnect: true`.
- Sets `DEV_REMOTE_CONTEXT`/`TILT_REMOTE=1` so Tilt pushes to the staging repositories in GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/ameideio/...`) and restricts allowed contexts to the AKS cluster.
- Documents the workflow in `docs/dev-workflows/telepresence.md`.

### Retired: Offline-minimal
- The minimal profile previously disabled first-party apps and heavy data plane components. It introduced persistent Argo health noise (missing services, invalid specs) and duplicate Helm/Kustomize plumbing. Removing it restored a single source of truth for GitOps and simplified onboarding.

## Backlog (epics + tasks)

### Epic DC-0 – Mode selection & wiring ✅ COMPLETED
- `.devcontainer/postCreate.sh` accepts `{offline-full|online-telepresence}` and logs the choice (default: offline-full).
- Mode map now directly selects the single bootstrap config or remote context; no profile indirection remains.

### Epic DC-2 – Offline-minimal mode ❌ RETIRED
- All profile-specific values/templates were deleted. Any future "lightweight" dev story should reuse Tilt/Terraform caches rather than a second GitOps projection.

### Epic DC-3 – Runtime switching between offline modes 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- `tools/dev/devcontainer-mode.sh offline-full [--reset]` reapplies the bootstrap with optional k3d reset. No alternate mode exists anymore; script is retained for convenience when re-syncing the full stack.

### Epic DC-4 – Online-telepresence mode

> **Note:** This epic is aligned with [434-unified-environment-naming.md](434-unified-environment-naming.md#epic-env-3) for telepresence implementation.

- **DC-30 – Devcontainer bootstrap for online-telepresence** ✅ `.devcontainer/postCreate.sh` persists the mode, switches contexts, and logs mode selection.
- **DC-31 – Telepresence connect helper** ✅ `tools/dev/telepresence.sh` wraps `telepresence connect|leave|status`, and the CLI is installed automatically inside the devcontainer.
- **DC-32 – Tilt remote toggle (`TILT_REMOTE`)** ✅ `Tiltfile` reads `TILT_REMOTE=1`, restricts allowed contexts to AKS, and defaults the registry host to `ghcr.io/ameideio` so `registry_image()` pushes remote tags.
- **DC-33 – Telepresence bootstrap config** ✅ `infra/environments/dev/bootstrap-telepresence.yaml` describes the AKS context and auto-connect settings; `postCreate.sh` consumes it.

**Blocker:** Remote AKS cluster must be migrated to `ameide-gitops` structure before telepresence mode is fully functional. See [434 Migration Needed](434-unified-environment-naming.md#migration-needed) for the cluster-side work.

### Epic DC-5 – Docs & UX
- **DC-50 – Devcontainer modes HOWTO** ⏳ Needs refresh to reflect the simplified mode matrix and the removal of the minimal profile trace.

## 433-codex-cli-057.md

# 433 – Codex CLI 0.57.0 Pin

## Context

- The default CLI delivered with the VS Code extension was `codex-cli 0.61.1-alpha.1`, but the workspace needs to remain on **0.57.0** until we explicitly qualify newer releases.
- The process to downgrade locally was:
  1. Uninstall any existing npm shim (`npm uninstall -g @openai/codex`).
  2. Fetch the 0.57.0 aarch64 Linux artifact from [rust-v0.57.0](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.57.0).
  3. Expand it into `~/.local/share/codex-cli/0.57.0/codex` and point `~/.local/bin/codex` at that binary.
- `~/.codex/config.toml` now explicitly sets `model = "gpt-5-codex"` with `model_reasoning_effort = "high"` so every CLI invocation consistently targets the desired back-end model.
- Note: This pin governs the codex binary used by shell sessions and automation in the DevContainer. The VS Code Codex extension ships its own CLI; set **Settings → Extensions → Codex → Codex: CLI Path** to `~/.local/bin/codex` (or the explicit version path) if the IDE agent itself must run 0.57.0.

## Devcontainer automation

To prevent new containers from drifting back to the extension-provided CLI:

- Added `.devcontainer/lib/codex-cli.sh` with `ensure_codex_cli_version()`. It:
  - Detects the current architecture (`x86_64` or `aarch64`).
  - Downloads `<release>/codex-<triple>.tar.gz` from the GitHub release.
  - Installs each version under `~/.local/share/codex-cli/<version>/codex`.
  - Maintains the `~/.local/bin/codex` symlink so PATH resolution matches the manual workflow.
- Keeps `$HOME/.local/bin` on `PATH` via `.bashrc` so new shells (bash/zsh) automatically honor the versioned symlink.
- `ensure_codex_config()` writes `~/.codex/config.toml` with `model = "gpt-5-codex"` and `model_reasoning_effort = "high"` (overridable via `DEVCONTAINER_CODEX_MODEL` and `DEVCONTAINER_CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT`). Both the CLI and the VS Code extension read this file, so their model settings stay in lockstep.
- Updated `.devcontainer/postCreate.sh` to source that helper and run it with `DEVCONTAINER_CODEX_VERSION` (defaults to `0.57.0`). Reopening the container now guarantees `codex --version` reports 0.57.0 before any bootstrap work begins.

## Operator checklist

- **Verify local CLI** – `codex --version` should always output `codex-cli 0.57.0`.
- **Override (if needed)** – set `DEVCONTAINER_CODEX_VERSION` in the container env/context to test a newer release without touching the default.
- **Config audit** – `ensure_codex_config()` writes `~/.codex/config.toml` automatically, but periodically confirm it still lists `model = "gpt-5-codex"` / `model_reasoning_effort = "high"` (or update the `DEVCONTAINER_CODEX_MODEL/DEVCONTAINER_CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` env vars if we intentionally test alternates).
- **VS Code extension** – if the IDE agent must use the pinned binary, set the Codex extension’s **CLI Path** to `~/.local/bin/codex`; otherwise it will keep running the bundled CLI version.

## Follow-ups

- Track upstream CLI regressions and file an upgrade plan before unpinning.
- Add CI smoke coverage that ensures `codex-cli --version` is `0.57.0` when devcontainer bootstrap scripts are exercised.

# 434 – Unified Environment Naming and Telepresence Wiring

> **Note:** This document remains relevant for environment naming conventions.
> The telepresence wiring and remote development workflow has been further refined in
> [435-remote-first-development.md](435-remote-first-development.md).

> **Related documents:**
> - [443-tenancy-models.md](443-tenancy-models.md) – **Tenancy model overview (single source of truth)**

## Goals
- Standardize environment naming across all contexts: local devcontainer, remote AKS namespaces, and GitOps configurations.
- Enable seamless switching between local inner-loop development and remote cluster work via telepresence.
- Migrate domain naming from `tilt.ameide.io` to `local.ameide.io` for consistency.

## Environment Matrix

| Environment | Kube Context | Namespace | Domain | Purpose | Status |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| `ameide-dev` | `ameide-dev` | `ameide-dev` | `dev.ameide.io` | Stable development | ✅ On shared AKS |
| `ameide-staging` | `ameide-staging` | `ameide-staging` | `staging.ameide.io` | Staging | ✅ On shared AKS |
| `ameide-prod` | `ameide-prod` | `ameide-prod` | `ameide.io` | Production | ⏸️ Namespace reserved |

> **Naming note:** As finalized in [435-remote-first-development.md](435-remote-first-development.md), local development tunnels into the shared AKS cluster. All contexts follow the `ameide-{environment}` convention and simply select different namespaces inside the single `ameide` cluster.

## Tenancy & Environment Matrix

In addition to dev/staging/production environments, AMEIDE supports three tenancy models. See [443-tenancy-models.md](443-tenancy-models.md) for comprehensive documentation.

| Tenancy Model | Cluster Pattern | Namespace Pattern | Example Domains |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Shared SaaS | Single shared cluster `ameide` | `ameide-prod` | `*.ameide.io` |
| Namespace-per-tenant | Single shared cluster per region | `tenant-<slug>-prod` (per tenant) | `<slug>.ameide.io`, `api.<slug>.ameide.io` |
| Private cloud (per-tenant) | Dedicated cluster `ameide-<slug>` per tenant | `ameide-dev/staging/prod` inside tenant cluster | `*.customer-domain.tld` or `*.ameide-<slug>.io` |

Tenancy is **orthogonal** to environment:
- We always keep `ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod` as internal environments.
- For namespace-per-tenant and private cloud, each tenant gets its own "production" environment running the same components.

### Shared AKS Cluster

- **Resource group:** `Ameide`
- **Cluster name:** `ameide`
- **Kube contexts:** `ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod` (all reference the same API server, differing only by namespace/user bindings)
- **Namespaces:** `ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod`, plus `argocd` and platform shared namespaces

### Namespace & Pod Labels

All workloads MUST be labeled consistently to support environment and tenant isolation (see [441-networking.md](441-networking.md), [442-environment-isolation.md](442-environment-isolation.md)):

| Label | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `ameide.io/environment` | `dev`, `staging`, `production`, `cluster` | SDLC stage |
| `ameide.io/tenant-kind` | `shared`, `namespace`, `private` | Tenancy model |
| `ameide.io/tenant-id` | `<tenant-slug>` (e.g., `acme`, `contoso`) | Tenant identifier |
| `ameide.io/tier` | `frontend`, `backend`, `data`, `platform`, `foundation` | Service tier |

**Examples:**

Shared SaaS `ameide-prod` namespace:
```yaml
metadata:
  name: ameide-prod
  labels:
    ameide.io/environment: production
    ameide.io/tenant-kind: shared
```

Namespace-per-tenant `tenant-acme-prod` namespace:
```yaml
metadata:
  name: tenant-acme-prod
  labels:
    ameide.io/environment: production
    ameide.io/tenant-kind: namespace
    ameide.io/tenant-id: acme
```

Backend pod labels:
```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    ameide.io/environment: production
    ameide.io/tenant-kind: namespace
    ameide.io/tenant-id: acme
    ameide.io/tier: backend
```

> **Reference:** See [443-tenancy-models.md](443-tenancy-models.md) for complete label documentation.

### Control plane & image ownership

- **Argo CD:** A single Argo instance in the `argocd` namespace reconciles every environment namespace using a **single parametrized ApplicationSet**. There are no per-namespace Argo installations or per-environment ApplicationSet files; isolation is enforced by Git (Projects) and RBAC, not by multiple controllers.
- **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):** `ameide-gitops` defines the repository/tag per environment. CI pushes images to GHCR, updates the GitOps values, and Argo syncs. No doc/tooling should reference Azure Container Registry directly.
- **Tilt-only releases:** Developers still run Tilt + Telepresence for the inner loop. Those resources carry the `-tilt` suffix and point at developer-scoped tags in GHCR but never alter the Argo-managed baselines.

### GitOps Repository Structure

        └── production/
            └── globals.yaml             # namespace: ameide-prod
```

### Single Parametrized ApplicationSet

Instead of duplicating ApplicationSet files per environment, a **single ApplicationSet** generates Applications for all environments:

```yaml
# argocd/applicationsets/ameide.yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: ameide
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  generators:
    - matrix:
        generators:
          - list:
              elements:
                - env: dev
                  namespace: ameide-dev
                - env: staging
                  namespace: ameide-staging
                - env: production
                  namespace: ameide-prod
          - git:
              repoURL: https://github.com/ameideio/ameide-gitops.git
              revision: main
              files:
                - path: environments/_shared/components/**/component.yaml
  template:
    metadata:
      name: '{{ .env }}-{{ .name }}'
    spec:
      destination:
        namespace: '{{ .namespace }}'  # From list generator
      sources:
        - helm:
            valueFiles:
              - '$values/sources/values/{{ .env }}/globals.yaml'
              - '$values/sources/values/_shared/{{ .domain }}/{{ .name }}.yaml'
              - '$values/sources/values/{{ .env }}/{{ .domain }}/{{ .name }}.yaml'
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero duplication of ApplicationSet logic
- Namespace is explicit per environment in the list generator
- Component.yaml files remain environment-agnostic
- Adding a new environment = adding one list element

#### ApplicationSet – Tenant-aware Generator (Future)

For namespace-per-tenant deployments, extend the `list` generator with tenants:

```yaml
generators:
  - matrix:
      generators:
        - list:
            elements:
              # Shared SaaS
              - env: production
                tenantKind: shared
                tenantId: shared
                namespace: ameide-prod
              # Namespace-per-tenant
              - env: production
                tenantKind: namespace
                tenantId: acme
                namespace: tenant-acme-prod
              - env: production
                tenantKind: namespace
                tenantId: contoso
                namespace: tenant-contoso-prod
        - git:
            files:
              - path: environments/_shared/components/**/component.yaml
```

Tenants only add new `list.elements` and per-tenant values under `sources/values/tenants/<tenant-id>/...`.

> **Scaling note**: For >20 tenants, consider replacing the `list` generator with a
> `git` generator that reads tenant definitions from `sources/values/tenants/*/tenant.yaml` files.

## Remote AKS Cluster Details

### Verified Cluster Information (2025-12-02)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Resource Group | `Ameide` |
| Cluster Name | `ameide` |
| Location | `westeurope` |
| Kubernetes Version | `1.32.7` |
| Nodes | 8 (d2as VMSS) |
| Kube Contexts | `ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod` |

### Current GitOps Configuration (LEGACY)
⚠️ **Note**: The remote AKS cluster uses an **older GitOps structure**:
- **Repo**: `https://github.com/ameideio/ameide.git` (main monorepo)
- **Path**: `infra/kubernetes/gitops/argocd/applications`
- **NOT using**: `https://github.com/ameideio/ameide-gitops` (new structure)

### ArgoCD Status
- ArgoCD is installed and running in `argocd` namespace
- Applications are deployed via app-of-apps pattern
- Some applications showing `Degraded` or `ErrImagePull` status (cluster was stopped/starting)

### Current Namespaces
- `ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod` – per-environment workloads (sharing the same AKS cluster)
- `argocd` – ArgoCD control plane

### Migration Needed

> **This migration is a blocker for:**
> - Bootstrap v2 targeting AKS clusters ([367 Phase 2](367-bootstrap-v2.md#phase-2-remote-cluster-support-in-progress))
> - Telepresence mode ([432 DC-4](432-devcontainer-modes-offline-online.md#epic-dc-4--online-telepresence-mode))

To align with the new structure, the remote cluster needs:

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **MIGRATE-1** | Delete legacy GitOps path (`ameide.git/infra/kubernetes/gitops/`) | ⏳ Pending |
| **MIGRATE-2** | Point Argo CD at `ameide-gitops` repo with `argocd/` path | ⏳ Pending |
| **MIGRATE-3** | Create `argocd/` structure with single parametrized ApplicationSet | ⏳ Pending |
| **MIGRATE-4** | Create `bootstrap/configs/` for each environment | ⏳ Pending |
| **MIGRATE-5** | Namespace split: `ameide` → `ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod` within the single `ameide` cluster | ⏳ Pending |
| **MIGRATE-6** | Create kube contexts/users `ameide-{env}` that target the shared cluster but default to the matching namespace | ⏳ Pending |
| **MIGRATE-7** | Consolidate ApplicationSets into single parametrized file | ⏳ Pending |
| **MIGRATE-8** | Verify cluster is fully reproducible via bootstrap-v2 | ⏳ Pending |
| **MIGRATE-9** | Update service URLs in values files to use `{{ .Values.namespace }}` | ✅ Complete |
| **MIGRATE-10** | Remove hardcoded `namespace: ameide` from shared values; use `{{ .Release.Namespace }}` | ✅ Complete |

**Approach:** The legacy GitOps content should be removed entirely (not migrated). The AKS cluster should be bootstrapped fresh using `bootstrap-v2.sh` once the `argocd/` structure exists in `ameide-gitops`.

### Migration Status Update (2025-12-04)

> **Note:** This section tracks current implementation status.

| Task | Current Status | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **MIGRATE-1** | ⏳ Blocked | Legacy path still in use on cluster |
| **MIGRATE-2** | ⏳ Blocked | Requires MIGRATE-1 |
| **MIGRATE-3** | ✅ Complete | `argocd/applicationsets/ameide.yaml` created |
| **MIGRATE-4** | ✅ Complete | `bootstrap/configs/` exists |
| **MIGRATE-5** | ✅ Complete | Namespaces `ameide-dev/staging/prod` exist on cluster |
| **MIGRATE-6** | ✅ Complete | Contexts configured in `scripts/devcontainer/bootstrap-contexts.sh` |
| **MIGRATE-7** | ✅ Complete | Single parametrized ApplicationSet in `argocd/applicationsets/ameide.yaml` |
| **MIGRATE-8** | ⏳ Blocked | Requires MIGRATE-1 & MIGRATE-2 |
| **MIGRATE-9** | ✅ Complete | Service URLs updated to use short names (Kubernetes DNS resolves within namespace) |
| **MIGRATE-10** | ✅ Complete | Hardcoded `namespace: ameide` removed from ~50 files; templates use `{{ .Release.Namespace }}` or `{{ .Values.namespace }}` |

**Current Blocker:** AKS cluster still points at legacy GitOps path (`ameide.git/infra/kubernetes/gitops/`).

**Repository Refactoring (Complete):**
- [x] Create `argocd/applicationsets/ameide.yaml` (single parametrized ApplicationSet)
- [x] Create `argocd/projects/` (shared project definitions)
- [x] Create `argocd/kustomization.yaml`
- [x] Add `namespace` field to `globals.yaml` for each environment
- [x] Update service URLs to use short names (same-namespace DNS resolution)
- [x] Remove `environments/*/argocd/` directories (replaced by `argocd/`)
- [x] Remove hardcoded `namespace: ameide` from all shared values files
- [x] Update ExternalSecret manifests to use `{{ .Release.Namespace }}`
- [x] Update CNPG postgres cluster to use dynamic namespace (removed `namespaceOverride`)
- [x] Add tier labels (`tier`, `domain`, `exposure`) to all app values files for NetworkPolicy support
- [x] Update chart defaults to use `.Release.Namespace` (gateway, redis, kafka, clickhouse, etc.)
- [x] Update environment gateway configs to use `{{ .Values.namespace }}`
- [x] Update observability smoke tests to use `{{ .Release.Namespace }}`
- [x] Update cert-manager issuer templates to use dynamic gateway namespace
- [x] Update Grafana datasources to use dynamic service URLs

**Remaining Operational Steps:**
- [ ] Point ArgoCD on AKS cluster at `ameide-gitops` repo with `argocd/` path
- [ ] Delete legacy GitOps path from `ameide.git`
- [ ] Verify full cluster sync with new structure

## Backlog

### Epic ENV-1 – Environment Naming Standardization

- **ENV-10 – Update local domain from tilt.ameide.io to local.ameide.io** ✅ Completed

  Goal: Consistent naming across all environments.

  **Updated components:**
  | File | Change |
  |------|--------|
| *(legacy)* `.devcontainer/manage-host-domains.sh` | removed in the remote-first workflow; Telepresence handles DNS routing |
  | `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/values/local/apps/platform/gateway.yaml` | `https-local` listener + `auth.local.ameide.io` route |
  | `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/values/dev/platform/platform-cert-manager-config.yaml` | Wildcard SANs for `*.local.ameide.io` |
  | `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/values/dev/apps/apps-www-ameide(-platform)-tilt.yaml` | Hostnames + cookie domains moved to `local.ameide.io` |
  | `gitops/ameide-gitops/sources/values/_shared/platform/platform-keycloak-realm.yaml` | Redirect URIs include the local origin |

  Certificates inherit the new SANs automatically and documentation now references `local.ameide.io` (see [367-bootstrap-v2.md §3.8](367-bootstrap-v2.md#38-domain-naming)).

- **ENV-11 – Standardize kube context naming** ⏳ Not started

  Goal: Predictable context names across all environments.

| Environment | Context Name | Command |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Dev (AKS) | `ameide-dev` | `az aks get-credentials --name ameide --resource-group Ameide --overwrite-existing --context ameide-dev && kubectl config set-context ameide-dev --namespace=ameide-dev` |
| Staging (AKS) | `ameide-staging` | `az aks get-credentials --name ameide --resource-group Ameide --overwrite-existing --context ameide-staging && kubectl config set-context ameide-staging --namespace=ameide-staging` |
| Production (AKS) | `ameide-prod` | `az aks get-credentials --name ameide --resource-group Ameide --overwrite-existing --context ameide-prod && kubectl config set-context ameide-prod --namespace=ameide-prod` |

  Update bootstrap configs and `postCreate.sh` to reference standardized names.

- **ENV-12 – Document namespace conventions** ⏳ Not started

  Goal: Clear mapping between environments and namespaces.

  | Environment | Namespace | Notes |
  |-------------|-----------|-------|
  | Dev (AKS) | `ameide-dev` | Used by contexts/tools targeting `ameide-dev` |
  | Staging (AKS) | `ameide-staging` | Used by contexts/tools targeting `ameide-staging` |
  | Production (AKS) | `ameide-prod` | Reserved for prod workloads |

  **Decision:** A single AKS cluster hosts all environments; Kubernetes namespaces provide isolation while shared services (e.g., `argocd`, `observability`) remain cluster-scoped.

### Epic ENV-2 – Remote AKS Verification ✅ COMPLETED

- **ENV-20 – Verify AKS cluster is running** ✅
  Goal: Confirm remote cluster is healthy and accessible.
  Result:
- Cluster `ameide` in `Ameide` RG is running (8 nodes, K8s 1.32.7) and serves all environments via namespaces
- Shared `ameide` cluster hosts `ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, and `ameide-prod` namespaces; staging workloads now live in `ameide-staging`.
  - kubelogin installed for Azure AD auth
  Status: Completed.

- **ENV-21 – Verify ArgoCD is installed and syncing** ✅
  Goal: Confirm GitOps is operational on remote cluster.
  Result:
  - ArgoCD installed in `argocd` namespace
  - Using **legacy** app-of-apps from `ameide.git/infra/kubernetes/gitops/` (NOT ameide-gitops)
  - Applications: agents, agents-runtime, platform, repository, workflow, www-ameide, www-ameide-platform
  - Some apps degraded due to cluster restart (ErrImagePull, Progressing)
  Status: Completed (with findings).

- **ENV-22 – Verify ameide namespace is healthy** ✅
  Goal: Confirm dev environment workloads are running.
  Result:
- Workloads run inside the per-environment namespaces (`ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod`)
  - Pods starting up after cluster restart
  - Some image pull issues (likely registry auth after cluster scale-up)
  Status: Completed (cluster recovering).

### Epic ENV-3 – Telepresence Implementation

> **Note:** This epic is aligned with [432-devcontainer-modes-offline-online.md](432-devcontainer-modes-offline-online.md#epic-dc-4--online-telepresence-mode) for devcontainer integration.
>
> **Blocker:** Requires [Remote GitOps Migration](#migration-needed) to be completed first.

- **ENV-30 – Install telepresence in devcontainer** ✅ Completed
  - Telepresence CLI installed via `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` (pinned version in `TELEPRESENCE_VERSION` ARG).
  - **Capabilities:** `devcontainer.json` includes `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN` and `--device=/dev/net/tun` in `runArgs` for VIF tunnel support.
  - Maps to [432 DC-31](432-devcontainer-modes-offline-online.md#epic-dc-4--online-telepresence-mode)

- **ENV-31 – Create telepresence connect helper script** ✅ Completed

  `tools/dev/telepresence.sh` exposes `connect|leave|status`, defaults to context `ameide-dev` (override with `TELEPRESENCE_CONTEXT`) / namespace `ameide-dev`, and is invoked automatically from `postCreate.sh`.

- **ENV-32 – Wire telepresence into online-telepresence mode** ✅ Completed
  - `.devcontainer/postCreate.sh` reads the telepresence config, writes `~/.devcontainer-mode.env`, switches the kube context to whichever `ameide-{env}` context is requested (default `ameide-dev`), and auto-connects via `tools/dev/telepresence.sh` when `autoConnect: true`.
  - Tilt picks up `DEV_REMOTE_CONTEXT`/`TILT_REMOTE=1` so remote registries/hosts are wired automatically.

- **ENV-33 – Configure Tilt for remote mode (TILT_REMOTE)** ✅ Completed
  - Add `TILT_REMOTE=1` environment variable support
  - Update Tiltfile to switch registry/context based on env
  - Update image push targets for remote registry (`ghcr.io/ameideio/*`)
  - Maps to [432 DC-32](432-devcontainer-modes-offline-online.md#epic-dc-4--online-telepresence-mode)

- **ENV-34 – Document telepresence workflow** ✅ Completed

  `docs/dev-workflows/telepresence.md` captures prerequisites (Azure login + AKS access), connect/disconnect commands, and Tilt usage in remote mode.

### Epic ENV-4 – Bootstrap Config Updates

> **Note:** Maps to [432 DC-33](432-devcontainer-modes-offline-online.md#epic-dc-4--online-telepresence-mode) and [367 Phase 3](367-bootstrap-v2.md#phase-3-telepresence-integration-pending).

- **ENV-40 – Add bootstrap-telepresence.yaml** ✅ Completed

  `infra/environments/dev/bootstrap-telepresence.yaml` defines the AKS context, sets `gitops.skip: true`, and enables `telepresence.autoConnect` for the `ameide-dev` namespace.

- **ENV-41 – Update postCreate.sh for telepresence bootstrap** ✅ Completed
  - Add `BOOTSTRAP_TELEPRESENCE_CONFIG` variable pointing to `bootstrap-telepresence.yaml`
  - Update `run_bootstrap_for_mode()` online-telepresence case to:
    1. Load telepresence config
    2. Set kube context
    3. Optionally call telepresence connect
    4. Skip GitOps apply (remote cluster is Argo-managed)

- **ENV-42 – Create staging bootstrap config** ⏳ Not started

  Create `infra/environments/staging/bootstrap.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  env: staging
  cluster:
    context: ameide-staging
    type: aks
  gitops:
    root: gitops/ameide-gitops
    env: staging
    rootApplication: gitops/ameide-gitops/environments/staging/argocd/applications/ameide.yaml
  bicepOutputsFile: artifacts/bicep-outputs/staging.json
  secrets:
    repo:
      # Use workload identity or Key Vault for AKS
      strategy: workload-identity
  ```

  See [367 Phase 2](367-bootstrap-v2.md#phase-2-remote-cluster-support-in-progress) for staging bootstrap requirements.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| [432](432-devcontainer-modes-offline-online.md) – Devcontainer modes | ✅ Complete | Provides mode framework |
| [367](367-bootstrap-v2.md) – Bootstrap v2 | ✅ Phase 1 complete | Local dev working |
| Azure subscription access for AKS | ✅ Available | Both clusters accessible |
| Remote GitOps migration | ⏳ Pending | Blocker for telepresence |

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ `kubectl config get-contexts` shows `ameide-dev` (remote dev context in kubeconfig)
2. ⏳ `kubectl config get-contexts` shows the `ameide-staging` context (same cluster, staging namespace) after migration
3. ⏳ `telepresence connect` successfully connects to staging cluster
4. ⏳ Tilt can deploy services to remote cluster via telepresence
5. ✅ Domain naming is consistent (`local.ameide.io` for local, `*.ameide.io` for remote)
6. ⏳ AKS cluster is fully reproducible via `bootstrap-v2.sh --config infra/environments/staging/bootstrap.yaml`

## Implementation Order

1. **First**: Complete [Remote GitOps Migration](#migration-needed) (MIGRATE-1 through MIGRATE-7)
2. **Second**: [ENV-10](#epic-env-1--environment-naming-standardization) domain rename (`tilt.ameide.io` → `local.ameide.io`)
3. **Third**: [ENV-3](#epic-env-3--telepresence-implementation) telepresence implementation
4. **Fourth**: [ENV-4](#epic-env-4--bootstrap-config-updates) bootstrap configs for staging/telepresence

## Appendix: Certificate & Gateway Architecture

### Domain and Certificate Matrix

| Environment | Domain | DNS Zone | Issuer | Certificate |
|-------------|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| dev | `*.dev.ameide.io` | `dev.ameide.io` | `letsencrypt-dev-dns01` | `ameide-wildcard-tls` |
| staging | `*.staging.ameide.io` | `staging.ameide.io` | `letsencrypt-staging-dns01` | `ameide-wildcard-tls` |
| production | `*.ameide.io` | `ameide.io` | `letsencrypt-prod-dns01` | `ameide-wildcard-tls` |
| ArgoCD (cluster) | `argocd.ameide.io` | `ameide.io` | `letsencrypt-apex-dns01` | `argocd-ameide-io-tls` |

**Key decisions:**
- Production uses apex domain (`ameide.io`) directly — there is NO `prod.ameide.io`
- ArgoCD is cluster-level at `argocd.ameide.io`, not tied to any environment
- Each environment has its own DNS zone and ClusterIssuer

### Bicep → Helm Data Flow

Infrastructure values flow from Bicep to Helm via git:

# 435 - Remote-First Development Architecture

**Status:** Phase 1-2 Complete (core), Phases 3-5 Pending
**Created:** 2024-12-02
**Updated:** 2025-12-03
**Supersedes:** 432 (DevContainer Modes), parts of 367 (Bootstrap v2), parts of 429 (DevContainer Bootstrap)

## Overview

Pivot from dual-mode (offline-full k3d + online-telepresence) to a single **AKS + Telepresence + Tilt** model:

1. **ameide-gitops** owns all infrastructure-as-code (Argo CD, Helm, environments, bootstrap)
2. **ameide-core** owns first-party application code + Tilt + Telepresence tooling
3. **No local k3d cluster** - AKS dev cluster is the target

## Goals

- **Single cluster strategy** - All development happens against shared AKS dev cluster
- **Simpler DevContainer** - Just `telepresence connect` + `tilt up`
- **GitOps purity** - Infrastructure changes go through ameide-gitops PRs
- **Faster inner loop** - Telepresence intercepts bypass image build/push/deploy cycle
- **Reduced divergence** - No more k3d vs AKS configuration drift

## Non-Goals

- Offline development capability (accept network dependency)
- Per-developer isolated clusters (share dev namespace with developer-specific deployments)
- Local k3d clusters (fully remote-first)

## Why Remote Dev Cluster (No k3d)

Tilt's [Choosing a Local Dev Cluster](https://docs.tilt.dev/choosing_clusters.html) guide recommends remote dev clusters when:
- You have a dedicated infra team maintaining cluster setup
- Team is large enough to justify shared infrastructure
- You want consistent environments across all developers

We meet all three criteria:
- `ameide-gitops` repo + bootstrap scripts = dedicated infra
- GitOps team maintains AKS clusters
- Eliminates "works on my k3d" issues

**Trade-off accepted:** Network dependency. No offline development.

## Version Pinning

We standardize on **Telepresence 2.x** (currently 2.25.1). The exact version is pinned in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`.

Some CLI flags and behaviors evolve between minor versions. If you see unexpected behavior, check:
1. Your installed version: `telepresence version`
2. The pinned version in Dockerfile
3. The [Telepresence changelog](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/releases)

### Key Insight: Telepresence vs Tilt Roles

| Tool | Role | Builds Images? |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Telepresence** | Network tunnel + traffic intercepts | ❌ No |
| **Tilt** | Image builds, deployments, local resources | ✅ Yes |
| **ArgoCD** | GitOps baseline deployments | ❌ No (CI builds) |

**Telepresence** is purely networking:
- `telepresence connect` → VPN-like tunnel to cluster (DNS, service discovery)
- `telepresence intercept` → Route traffic from cluster pod to local process

**Tilt** handles builds and deployments:
- `docker_build` → Build image locally
- Push to ACR (via `default_registry`)
- Apply manifests to AKS
- `local_resource` → Run local processes (including intercepted services)

### Developer Workflow

```bash
# 1. Connect to cluster (VPN-like tunnel)
telepresence connect --context ameide-dev --namespace ameide-dev

# 2. Intercept the service you're developing
telepresence intercept www-ameide-platform --context ameide-dev --namespace ameide-dev --port 3000:3000 --env-file=.env.telepresence

# 3. Run locally with pod environment
source .env.telepresence && npm run dev
```

**What happens:**
- Traffic from AKS cluster → routed to your local process
- Code changes → instant (no container rebuild)
- Pod's ConfigMaps/Secrets → available via `--env-file`

**When to use full image builds (Tilt):**
- Dockerfile changes
- Dependency updates (package.json, go.mod, requirements.txt)
- Final integration testing before PR

### Tilt + Argo Coexistence (from 373/424)

The **isolation pattern** from backlogs 373 and 424 is preserved:

| Component | Owner | Release Name | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|--------------|---------|
| Baseline www-platform | ArgoCD | `apps-www-ameide-platform` | GitOps-managed baseline |
| Inner-loop www-platform | Tilt | `apps-www-ameide-platform-tilt` | Developer iteration |
| Shared services | ArgoCD | Various | Keycloak, databases, etc. |

**Why this matters:**
- No ownership conflicts (Tilt and Argo never touch same resources)
- No pause/resume dance with ArgoCD
- Tilt `-tilt` releases can have different configs (debug mode, local volumes, etc.)

## Infra bootstrap automation (2025-12-03)

- `scripts/deploy-managed-app.sh` replaces bespoke `az deployment` incantations. It loads `.env` / `.env.local`, reuses the gitignored AKS admin key pair generated by `scripts/ensure-aks-admin-key.sh`, injects the GitHub token securely, and wraps `az deployment group create`. After every run it captures the outputs JSON under `artifacts/bicep-outputs/<env>.json`.
- `scripts/update-globals-from-bicep.sh` consumes those outputs and rewrites `sources/values/<env>/globals.yaml` with the latest `azure.envoyPublicIpAddress` and DNS managed identity IDs, so Helm/Argo never drift from the Bicep truth. Commit the regenerated globals whenever the control plane IP or identity rotates.
- Managed application parameter files now set `enableDnsFederatedIdentity=true`, `envSecrets` is marked `@secure()`, and the new `modules/keyvaultEnvSecrets.bicep` mirrors every `.env` entry into Azure Key Vault automatically. Cert-manager’s Azure DNS workload identity credential appears on day one with no `az identity federated-credential` hand edits.
- `scripts/setup-service-principal.sh` provisions a Contributor-scoped service principal with a locally stored certificate (under `creds/service-principal/`). When its profile JSON exists, `scripts/deploy-managed-app.sh` automatically runs `az login --service-principal ...` so CI/automation can deploy without interactive `az login`.

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Move Infrastructure to GitOps Repo ✅ COMPLETE

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **INFRA-10** | Move `infra/kubernetes/scripts/` and `policies/` to gitops | ✅ |
| **INFRA-11** | Move `tools/bootstrap/` to gitops `bootstrap/` | ✅ |
| **INFRA-12** | Move `infra/environments/` configs to gitops `bootstrap/configs/` | ✅ |
| **INFRA-13** | Move `infra/bicep/` to gitops `bicep/` | ✅ |
| **INFRA-14** | Move `infra/azure/managed-application/` to gitops `azure/` | ✅ |
| **INFRA-15** | Update READMEs | ✅ |

### Phase 2: Simplify DevContainer (Remove k3d)

> **Status Update (2025-12-03):** DevContainer in ameide-gitops simplified. Telepresence workflow
> documented in `scripts/devcontainer/README.md`. Helper script (DC-14) not yet created; CLI
> installation (DC-15) uses cluster-side Traffic Manager (chart v2.25.1) but DevContainer-side
> CLI install is pending.

| Task | Description | Owner | Status |
|------|-------------|-------|--------|
| **DC-10** | Remove k3d cluster creation from postCreate.sh | - | ✅ Done |
| **DC-11** | Remove k3d feature from devcontainer.json | - | ✅ Done |
| **DC-12** | Remove ArgoCD bootstrap logic (Argo lives in AKS, managed by gitops) | - | ✅ Done |
| **DC-13** | Add AKS credential setup (az login + kubelogin) | - | ✅ Done |
| **DC-14** | Create `tools/dev/telepresence.sh` helper script | - | ⏳ Workflow in README, script not created |
| **DC-15** | Install Telepresence CLI in Dockerfile | - | ⏳ Cluster-side ready, CLI install pending |
| **DC-16** | Remove `.devcontainer/lib/k3d.sh` and related modules | - | ✅ Done |

**Target postCreate.sh (~30 lines):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Configure kubectl for AKS (dev namespace)
az aks get-credentials --resource-group Ameide --name ameide --overwrite-existing --context ameide-dev
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l azurecli
kubectl config set-context ameide-dev --namespace=ameide-dev >/dev/null 2>&1 || true

echo "✅ Ready! Run './tools/dev/telepresence.sh connect' to connect to the cluster."
```

> **Note:** `telepresence connect` is an explicit developer step, not run automatically in postCreate.
> This lets developers see connection errors clearly and choose their namespace/context.

**Helper script `tools/dev/telepresence.sh`:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

case "${1:-}" in
  connect)
    telepresence connect --context ameide-dev --namespace ameide-dev
    ;;
  intercept)
    SERVICE="${2:?Usage: $0 intercept <service> [port]}"
    PORT="${3:-3000:3000}"
    telepresence intercept "$SERVICE" --context ameide-dev --namespace ameide-dev --port "$PORT" --env-file=.env.telepresence
    echo "Run: source .env.telepresence && <your-dev-command>"
    ;;
  status)
    telepresence status
    ;;
  quit)
    telepresence quit
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Usage: $0 {connect|intercept|status|quit}"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
```

### Phase 3: Adapt Tiltfile for Remote Cluster

| Task | Description | Owner |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **TILT-10** | Add `default_registry('ghcr.io/ameideio')` for GHCR | - |
| **TILT-11** | Update kubectl context defaults (remove k3d references) | - |
| **TILT-12** | Keep all `apps-*-tilt` Helm releases (373/424 architecture) | - |
| **TILT-13** | Add `local_resource` for Telepresence intercepts | - |
| **TILT-14** | Remove k3d-specific registry wiring (`k3d-ameide.localhost:5001`) | - |
| **TILT-15** | Update values paths to reference gitops submodule | - |
| **TILT-16** | Add Telepresence intercept helpers to `tilt/` | - |

**Example Tiltfile additions:**
```python
# Registry for AKS (GitHub Container Registry)
default_registry('ghcr.io/ameideio')

# Telepresence intercept mode (optional, for rapid iteration)
if config.tilt_subcommand == 'up' and os.getenv('TELEPRESENCE_INTERCEPT'):
    local_resource(
        'www-platform-intercept',
        serve_cmd='cd services/www_ameide_platform && npm run dev',
        deps=['services/www_ameide_platform/'],
        labels=['intercept'],
    )
```

| **CLEAN-16** | Update `.devcontainer/lib/` (remove k3d, argocd modules) | - |
| **CLEAN-17** | Remove k3d-related scripts from `tilt/` | - |

### Phase 5: Documentation & Validation

| Task | Description | Owner |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **DOC-10** | Update `docs/dev-workflows/telepresence.md` | - |
| **DOC-11** | Update main README.md | - |

## AKS Shared Cluster Requirements

### Cluster: `ameide`

- **Resource Group:** `Ameide`
- **Region:** `westeurope` (shared across all environments)
- **Node Pool:** Cost-optimized (B-series, spot instances) with autoscaling
- **Namespaces:**
  - `ameide-dev` – Dev workloads (default Telepresence namespace)
  - `ameide-staging` – Staging workloads
  - `ameide-prod` – Reserved for production workloads
  - `argocd`, `observability`, etc. – Shared platform components

### Argo CD control plane

- A single Argo installation in the `argocd` namespace reconciles every environment namespace (`ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod`) using ApplicationSets and Projects for boundaries.
- There is no per-environment Argo; isolation is achieved through Projects + RBAC and the GitOps repo structure.

### Image & tag authority

- **Source of truth:** `ameide-gitops` defines the repository + tag per environment. CI builds push to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/ameideio/...`) and update the GitOps values; Argo syncs those tags.
- **Tilt-only tags:** Developer iterations use the `*-tilt` releases and developer-scoped GHCR tags, never overwriting Argo-managed baselines.
- **Telepresence:** Only hijacks traffic; it does not inject or override images/tags.

### Pre-installed Components

| Component | Purpose | Managed By |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| ArgoCD | GitOps deployments | gitops bootstrap |
| Traffic Manager | Telepresence networking | gitops bootstrap |
| Envoy Gateway | Ingress/routing | ArgoCD |
| Keycloak | Auth | ArgoCD |
| PostgreSQL (CNPG) | Databases | ArgoCD |
| Redis | Caching | ArgoCD |

### Access Control

- Azure AD authentication via `kubelogin`
- RBAC: Developers get `edit` role in `ameide-dev` namespace
- Telepresence: Traffic Manager deployed cluster-side

### RBAC Requirements for Telepresence

Telepresence `intercept` and `replace` require permissions to patch workloads (Deployment/StatefulSet) in the target namespace. The `edit` ClusterRole provides this.

Required permissions:
- `get`, `list`, `watch` on deployments, statefulsets, services
- `patch`, `update` on deployments, statefulsets (for Traffic Agent injection)
- `create` on pods/exec (for some debugging features)

### ArgoCD + Telepresence Drift Avoidance

**Critical rule:** Only intercept Tilt-owned workloads (`apps-*-tilt`), never ArgoCD-managed baselines.

When Telepresence intercepts a workload, it:
- Injects a Traffic Agent sidecar container
- Adds annotations like `telepresence.getambassador.io/*`
- Modifies the pod spec

If you intercept an ArgoCD-managed workload, ArgoCD will see constant drift and fight to restore the original spec.

**Safe pattern:**
```bash
# ✅ Safe: Intercept Tilt-owned release
telepresence intercept apps-www-ameide-platform-tilt --port 3000:3000

# ❌ Avoid: Intercept ArgoCD-managed baseline
telepresence intercept apps-www-ameide-platform --port 3000:3000
```

If you must intercept ArgoCD workloads in dev, configure ArgoCD to ignore Telepresence annotations:
```yaml
# In ArgoCD Application
spec:
  ignoreDifferences:
    - group: apps
      kind: Deployment
      jsonPointers:
        - /spec/template/metadata/annotations/telepresence.getambassador.io~1inject-traffic-agent
```

### Registry: GitHub Container Registry

- **Registry:** `ghcr.io/ameideio`
- **Auth:** GitHub token scoped for the release workflows
- **Used by:** Tilt image pushes, CI publishes, ArgoCD deployments (via GitOps values)

## Telepresence Reference

### Installation (in DevContainer)

```dockerfile
# In .devcontainer/Dockerfile
RUN curl -fL https://app.getambassador.io/download/tel2oss/releases/download/v2.25.1/telepresence-linux-amd64 \
    -o /usr/local/bin/telepresence && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/telepresence
```

### Core Commands

```bash
# Connect to cluster (VPN-like tunnel)
telepresence connect --context ameide-dev --namespace ameide-dev

# Check connection status
telepresence status

# List available services to intercept
telepresence list

# Intercept a service (app container keeps running, traffic mirrored)
telepresence intercept www-ameide-platform --context ameide-dev --namespace ameide-dev --port 3000:3000 --env-file=.env.telepresence

# Replace a service (app container stopped, only your local process handles traffic)
# Use this for queue consumers or when you need exclusive access
telepresence replace www-ameide-platform --port 3000:3000 -- npm run dev

# Leave intercept
telepresence leave www-ameide-platform

# Disconnect from cluster
telepresence quit
```

> **Note:** `--replace` flag on `intercept` is deprecated. Use `telepresence replace` instead.

### Environment Variables

Telepresence can import the intercepted pod's environment into your local process via:

1. **`--env-file`** (recommended) - Write env vars to a file:
   ```bash
   telepresence intercept my-service --port 3000:3000 --env-file=.env.telepresence
   source .env.telepresence && npm run dev
   ```

2. **`replace -- <command>`** - Run command with pod env applied:
   ```bash
   telepresence replace my-service --port 3000:3000 -- npm run dev
   ```

**Available variables:**
- `TELEPRESENCE_INTERCEPT_ID` - Unique intercept identifier
- `TELEPRESENCE_ROOT` - Mount point for pod filesystem (volumes)
- All env vars from the intercepted pod (ConfigMaps, Secrets)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Network dependency | Document offline limitations; accept this trade-off |
| Shared cluster conflicts | Namespace isolation; `-tilt` suffix releases; resource quotas |
| Slower image push to ACR | Use Telepresence intercepts for rapid iteration; only push for full tests |
| Azure auth complexity | Pre-configure kubelogin in DevContainer; document troubleshooting |
| Cost of always-on cluster | Auto-scaling; spot instances; shutdown schedule for nights/weekends |
| Telepresence sidecar drift | ArgoCD ignores Traffic Agent annotations in dev namespace |

---

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Fresh DevContainer starts in <5 minutes (no k3d bootstrap)
2. ✅ `telepresence connect` establishes cluster access in <30 seconds
3. ✅ `telepresence intercept` routes traffic to local process in <10 seconds
4. ✅ Zero infrastructure code in ameide-core repo
5. ✅ Single source of truth for cluster config in ameide-gitops
6. ✅ Developer can go from clone → running service in <10 minutes

# Backlog 436: Envoy Gateway Observability

**Status**: Implemented
**Updated**: 2025-12-04

## Overview

This document specifies the observability configuration for Envoy Gateway, including Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry access logs. The implementation uses an `EnvoyProxy` resource referenced by the `GatewayClass` via `parametersRef`.

## Related Backlogs

| Backlog | Topic | Relationship |

## Background

The `ClientTrafficPolicy` resource does not support `spec.telemetry` in Envoy Gateway v1.6.0. The invalid template was removed in commit `f2feec8`. Telemetry must be configured via an `EnvoyProxy` resource with `spec.telemetry`, referenced from the `GatewayClass`.

## Architecture

## Existing ServiceMonitors

Prometheus scraping configured via ServiceMonitors (file: `sources/charts/apps/gateway/templates/servicemonitors.yaml`):

| ServiceMonitor | Target | Port | Interval |
|----------------|--------|------|----------|
| `platform-envoy-gateway` | Envoy Gateway control plane | metrics | 30s |
| `platform-envoy-ratelimit` | Rate limiter | metrics | 30s |

## Verification

### Check EnvoyProxy resource

```bash
kubectl get envoyproxy -n envoy-gateway-system
kubectl describe envoyproxy ameide-proxy-config -n envoy-gateway-system

# Verify static IP is configured
kubectl get envoyproxy ameide-proxy-config -n envoy-gateway-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.provider}'

# Check cluster gateway EnvoyProxy (argocd namespace)
kubectl get envoyproxy cluster-proxy-config -n argocd
```

### Check GatewayClass references EnvoyProxy

```bash
kubectl get gatewayclass envoy -o yaml | grep -A5 parametersRef
```

### Verify access logs in Loki

```bash
curl -s "http://$LOKI_IP:3100/loki/api/v1/query_range" \
  --data-urlencode "query={exporter=\"OTLP\"}" | jq '.data.result[0].values'
```

### Verify Prometheus metrics

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n envoy-gateway-system svc/envoy-gateway 19001:19001
curl http://localhost:19001/metrics
```

## Future Enhancements

The following features are available but not currently configured:

- **CEL filtering**: Filter logs based on headers/request attributes
- **Separate Listener logs**: Different format/sink for connection-level failures
- **Route metadata enrichment**: Add HTTPRoute/GRPCRoute metadata to logs
- **gRPC ALS sink**: Alternative to OpenTelemetry for access log streaming

## 437-split-frontend-cdn-evaluation.md

Here’s a vendor-aligned rewrite of your document.

# Split Frontend to CDN – Azure Best Practices Aligned

## Summary

Evaluate how to align `www-ameide` (marketing) and `www-ameide-platform` (app) with **Azure-recommended architectures for internet-facing web applications**:

* Use **Azure Front Door** as the **global edge entry point with CDN + WAF**. ([Microsoft Learn][1])
* Serve **static marketing content from a static hosting service + CDN** (Azure Static Web Apps or Storage+CDN). ([Microsoft Learn][2])
* Keep **dynamic, stateful workloads** (platform app, APIs, Keycloak) on **AKS** behind Front Door.

### Final Recommendation (vendor-aligned)

1. **Adopt Azure Front Door in front of AKS for both apps (Option B) as the new default.**
2. **Plan a refactor to move `www-ameide` to static hosting (Option A) once capacity allows.**
3. Treat “all traffic directly to AKS ingress” (current Option C) as a **transitional / legacy state**, not the target architecture.

---

## Current State

Both frontends run as Next.js containers in AKS:

* **Auth**: Auth.js + Keycloak OIDC
* **Sessions**: Redis (Sentinel HA for platform)
* **Ingress**: Envoy Gateway, public internet-facing
* **Delivery**: No global edge layer; static assets and HTML all served via AKS nodes
* **Deployment**: GitOps via ArgoCD

### App Comparison

| Feature      | `www-ameide` (Marketing) | `www-ameide-platform` (App) |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Auth         | Keycloak + Auth.js       | Keycloak + Auth.js          |
| Sessions     | Redis                    | Redis Sentinel (HA)         |
| Database     | None                     | PostgreSQL                  |
| WebSocket    | Client connects to API   | Client connects to API      |
| gRPC calls   | Envoy proxy              | Envoy proxy (internal)      |
| AI APIs      | None                     | OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure    |
| Telemetry    | None                     | OpenTelemetry               |
| File uploads | None                     | Persistent volume           |

**Deviation vs vendor best practices**

* No **central global edge entry point** (Front Door) for performance and security. ([Microsoft Learn][3])
* Static content is not served from a dedicated **static hosting + CDN** solution. ([Microsoft Learn][4])
* No **WAF on the public edge**; protection is only at the cluster/application level. ([Microsoft Learn][5])

---

## Target Azure Architecture Principles

Target state is guided by Azure’s recommended patterns for public web apps: ([Microsoft Learn][1])

1. **Single global edge entry point**

   * Azure Front Door in front of all public HTTP(S) endpoints (`www-ameide`, `www-ameide-platform`, `auth`, `api`).
   * Origins (AKS, Static Web Apps, Storage) **accept traffic only from Front Door** (Private Link or `X-Azure-FDID`/service tags). ([Microsoft Learn][6])

2. **Static content offload**

   * Marketing/frontdoor pages hosted on **Static Web Apps or Storage+CDN**.
   * AKS used only for dynamic workloads and APIs.

3. **Security on the edge**

   * End-to-end TLS, HTTP→HTTPS redirect, managed certificates on Front Door. ([Microsoft Learn][6])
   * Azure WAF on Front Door with managed rule sets, tuned for the apps. ([Microsoft Learn][5])

4. **Operational excellence**

   * Infrastructure as code (Bicep/Terraform/ARM) for Front Door, WAF, DNS.
   * Centralized logging/metrics from Front Door + AKS.

---

## Options

### Option A: Static Marketing Site + CDN (Target for `www-ameide`)

Convert the **marketing site** to a static or SSG build and host it on **Azure Static Web Apps** (or Azure Storage + CDN / Front Door origin).

| Aspect   | Details                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Scope    | `www-ameide` (marketing) only                    |
| Hosting  | Azure Static Web Apps (preferred) or Storage+CDN |
| Auth     | Client-side OIDC against Keycloak                |
| Sessions | Token-based; remove Redis dependency             |
| Cost     | $0 (Free tier) or ~$9/mo (Standard) for SWA      |
| Effort   | 2–4 weeks refactor                               |

**Changes required**

* Configure Next.js for static output (`output: "export"` or equivalent; remove SSR-only pages).
* Move from Auth.js server sessions to **client-side OIDC (PKCE) with tokens** in memory + secure cookies.
* Replace any server-only logic in pages with **client-side API calls** to the platform/backend.

**Pros (vendor best practice)**

* **Static Content Hosting pattern**: static files from a global edge cache, minimal compute. ([Microsoft Learn][4])
* **Independent deployment & scaling** for marketing vs platform.
* Offloads marketing traffic from AKS, reducing node pressure and simplifying capacity planning.
* Aligned with Azure’s **“SPA + API + IdP”** guidance.

**Cons / Risks**

* Significant refactor effort, especially around Auth.js and any SSR usage.
* Loss of SSR on marketing pages (SEO must rely on SSG/build-time rendering).
* Introduces a second deployment model alongside GitOps (unless you wire SWA into GitOps via ARM/Bicep/Terraform).

**Recommended role:**
**Strategic target state for the marketing site** once Option B is in place and there is time/budget for refactor.

---

### Option B: Azure Front Door + AKS (New Default)

Introduce **Azure Front Door Standard or Premium** as the **global entry point** for all public endpoints, with AKS as origin.

| Aspect   | Details                                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope    | `www-ameide`, `www-ameide-platform`, `auth`, `api`    |
| Hosting  | AKS (unchanged), Front Door as edge                   |
| Security | TLS termination, optional WAF (Premium)               |
| Cost     | ~$35/mo (Standard) or ~$330/mo (Premium with WAF)     |
| Effort   | 1–2 days for initial setup; additional for WAF tuning |

**Changes required**

* Create **Azure Front Door** profile:

  * Origins: Envoy Gateway endpoints for both apps, plus API and Keycloak.
  * Custom domains: `www.ameide.io`, `platform.ameide.io`, `auth.ameide.io`, `api.ameide.io`.
* Configure route rules:

  * Static asset caching: `/_next/static/*`, `/images/*`, `/fonts/*`.
  * Path-based routing if needed (`/api/*`, `/auth/*`, etc.).
* Enable **HTTPS-only** and use managed certificates for custom domains.
* Optionally enable **WAF** (Premium), start in detection mode, then enforce. ([Microsoft Learn][1])
* Lock down AKS ingress to only accept traffic from Front Door (Private Link / `X-Azure-FDID` / service tags). ([Microsoft Learn][6])

**Pros (vendor best practice)**

* Directly matches Azure’s **recommended front-door-in-front-of-web-apps pattern**: global edge entry, CDN, WAF, managed TLS. ([Microsoft Learn][1])
* **No application changes**:

  * Auth.js, Redis, Keycloak, websockets, file uploads keep working.
* **Global CDN caching** for static assets reduces latency and AKS load.
* Single place for:

  * TLS termination.
  * WAF rules and bot protection.
  * Logging and request analytics.

**Cons**

* Additional monthly cost for Front Door + potential WAF.
* Infra complexity: one more component to manage as code.
* Need to integrate cache invalidation (purge) into CI/CD for static assets.

**Recommended role:**
**New baseline / default architecture** for production traffic.
Even if most users are EU-based today, this aligns with Azure guidance and sets a clean path for global expansion and improved security.

---

### Option C: Direct AKS Ingress (Legacy / Transitional)

Keep both apps in AKS, exposed directly through Envoy Gateway to the internet (current state).

| Aspect   | Details                                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Hosting  | AKS only, Envoy Gateway with public IP   |
| Security | TLS at Envoy; no WAF at edge             |
| Cost     | $0 incremental (no extra Azure services) |
| Effort   | None                                     |

**Pros**

* Simplest architecture from an operational point of view.
* GitOps-only model (ArgoCD) for all changes.
* Shared infrastructure (Redis, Keycloak, Envoy) already paid for.

**Cons vs vendor best practices**

* **No global edge layer** (no Front Door), contrary to recommended designs for internet-facing apps. ([Microsoft Learn][3])
* No built-in **WAF on the public edge**; harder to meet future compliance/security requirements. ([Microsoft Learn][5])
* All traffic hits AKS directly; no caching or offload of static content.

**Recommended role:**
Acceptable as a **transitional state** while traffic and security requirements are modest. Not the long-term target architecture.

## Decision Matrix (Vendor-Aligned)

| Scenario                                 | Recommendation (Best Practice)                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Most users in EU, but production-facing  | **Option B**: Front Door Standard in front of AKS for both apps                             |
| Global users, latency matters            | **Option B**: Front Door with aggressive static caching; later add Option A for marketing   |
| Need WAF / stronger security posture     | **Option B Premium**: Front Door Premium + WAF with managed rule sets                       |
| Marketing site independence / agility    | **Option A for `www-ameide`** (Static Web App or Storage+CDN) + **Option B** overall        |
| Tight budget, low risk, local usage only | Temporary **Option C**, but plan migration to **Option B** when traffic/security justify it |

---

## Recommendation

### 1. Adopt Front Door as the New Baseline

Move from “direct AKS ingress” to **Azure Front Door + AKS**:

* Implement **Option B** now:

  * Front Door Standard (or Premium if WAF needed).
  * Origins: `www-ameide`, `www-ameide-platform`, `auth`, `api`.
  * HTTPS-only, managed certificates, basic caching for static assets.
  * Lock AKS ingress to traffic from Front Door only.

This aligns the entire stack with Azure’s **recommended front-door pattern** for internet-facing workloads and prepares you for WAF and global expansion. ([Microsoft Learn][1])

### 2. Plan Static Hosting for Marketing

Treat **Option A** as the strategic evolution for `www-ameide`:

* Schedule a **2–4 week refactor** to:

  * Make `www-ameide` compatible with static/SSG output.
  * Switch auth to client-side OIDC tokens.
* Host on **Azure Static Web Apps** (or Storage+CDN) behind the same Front Door.
* Keep `www-ameide-platform` on AKS (dynamic app, websockets, uploads, AI, etc.).

### 3. Treat “All in AKS” as Transitional

Keep **Option C** as:

* A **short-term** cost-optimized state while Front Door is rolled out.
* Not the desired end-state in any scenario where:

  * Security, compliance, or WAF is required.
  * Latency for non-local users matters.
  * Marketing scaling or independence becomes important.

---

## Related / Clean-Up Actions

* **Existing Static Web App `ameide`**

  * Either repurpose it for the future `www-ameide` static site, or
  * Decommission it to avoid confusion until the refactor is planned.

* **DNS & Domains**

  * Align DNS so that **all public hostnames** resolve to Azure Front Door, not directly to Envoy/public IPs.
  * Use Front Door’s managed certificates for `ameide.io` and `*.ameide.io`.

* **Security Hardening**

  * Lock down AKS ingress to allow only Front Door (service tags / `X-Azure-FDID`) as the source. ([Microsoft Learn][6])
  * If using Front Door Premium, enable WAF in detection mode, tune rules, then switch to prevention.

This version puts the **Azure reference architecture** front and center and frames your current AKS-only approach as a stepping stone rather than the final destination.

From the point of view of CNCF / Linux Foundation–style thinking, the advice is basically:

> **Use open, vendor-neutral building blocks (CNCF projects), keep cloud-specific stuff thin and replaceable, and keep your data + control plane portable.** ([CNCF][1])

Let’s translate that into your world (Next.js + AKS + Keycloak + Envoy).

---

## 1. What “open source / Linux Foundation” people actually push

Across CNCF and Linux Foundation docs/blogs, a few themes repeat:

1. **Vendor-neutral core platform**

   * CNCF explicitly positions itself as a *vendor-neutral hub* to avoid any one vendor controlling your fate. ([CNCF][1])
   * Their guidance is: build on **open, portable APIs and runtimes** like:

     * Kubernetes, Envoy, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Argo, etc. ([CNCF][2])

2. **Avoid deep coupling to proprietary services**

   * Linux Foundation material and related analysis repeatedly mention that open source is adopted *specifically to avoid vendor lock-in* and unify technology investments. ([The Linux Foundation][3])
   * “Cloud-native” from a CNCF perspective means *portable*, not “use every shiny managed PaaS your cloud offers”. ([CNCF][4])

3. **Governance under neutral foundations**

   * When projects move under the Linux Foundation or CNCF, one stated benefit is reduced lock-in and more predictable licensing / governance (Redis → Valkey under LF is a recent example). ([altinity.com][5])

So an open-source community answer to “how should I architect this?” is roughly:

> **Put CNCF / LF projects at the center (Kubernetes, Envoy, OpenTelemetry, Argo, Keycloak, Postgres, etc.), and treat any particular cloud’s CDN or WAF as an optional edge plug-in, not as your platform.**

You’re actually *already* very aligned there.

---

## 2. Where your current setup already matches OSS/CNCF guidance

Your stack is basically a CNCF brochure:

* **Kubernetes** (AKS is still just Kubernetes – API-portable to any distro). ([CNCF][6])
* **Envoy** as ingress (CNCF graduated project, high-performance edge/service proxy). ([CNCF][2])
* **ArgoCD** (CNCF project) for GitOps. ([CNCF][6])
* **OpenTelemetry** for telemetry (CNCF). ([CNCF][6])
* **Keycloak, Redis, Postgres** – all OSS, independent of any single cloud.

From a CNCF/LF perspective, the *lock-in risk* is not AKS itself (you can move to any other Kubernetes), it’s how much you lean on **Azure-specific PaaS (Front Door, Static Web Apps, etc.)** vs OSS components you control.

---

## 3. What would OSS / Linux Foundation folks recommend for your “CDN split” topic?

### Principle 1 – Keep the “platform” OSS & portable

They’d say: your **platform** should be:

* Kubernetes + Envoy/Envoy Gateway (for ingress/API gateway) ([CNCF][2])
* Keycloak for auth (OSS, portable).
* Redis/Postgres/OpenTelemetry/ArgoCD.

Then you can run that platform:

* On AKS today.
* On EKS/GKE/on-prem/bare metal tomorrow, with no app changes other than cluster wiring.

### Principle 2 – Use OSS for HTTP edge & caching where feasible

Instead of Azure Front Door as your only option, OSS people would suggest:

* **Envoy Gateway** or other CNCF-ish ingress as your “edge gateway”:

  * Implements the Kubernetes Gateway API, is fully OSS, and designed for unified ingress + API gateway use. ([CNCF][7])
* Add an **OSS caching layer** in front of your apps for static content:

  * Examples: **Varnish Cache**, **Apache Traffic Server**, or even tuned **Nginx** as reverse proxies / HTTP accelerators – all widely used for building CDNs. ([Varnish Cache][8])

You can deploy these:

* As part of your Kubernetes cluster(s), or
* In a small dedicated edge cluster / PoP close to your users.

That gives you:

* The same “cache `/_next/static/*` and images at the edge” behavior you’d use Front Door for.
* But all implemented with OSS you can run on *any* cloud or on-prem.

### Principle 3 – Static hosting should be generic, not tied to one cloud

For the “static export marketing site” angle, the OSS-ish recommendation is:

* Do the **static export** with Next.js if it makes sense.
* Host the output on something **generic & swappable**:

  * S3-compatible object storage (e.g. MinIO, Ceph RGW) or plain blob storage.
  * Fronted by your OSS edge (Envoy/Varnish/Nginx) or any commodity CDN.
* Use only **standard HTTP, TLS, DNS** features – no proprietary vendor routing rules or serverless edge functions.

That means:

* Today: maybe it’s Azure Blob + OSS gateway / generic CDN.
* Tomorrow: it could be S3, GCS, or your own MinIO cluster, without touching the app.

This is exactly the sort of thing Linux Foundation and CNCF call out as a way to avoid lock-in: open protocols, open software, portable data formats. ([CNCF][4])

---

## 4. Concretely: what does that mean for your options A / B / C?

Taking your previous options and repainting them in “Linux Foundation / CNCF” colours:

### OSS-aligned Option 1 – Stay on Kubernetes + add OSS edge caching

Instead of Azure Front Door:

* Keep **both Next.js apps on Kubernetes** (AKS now, portable later).
* Use **Envoy Gateway** as your unified ingress/API gateway (CNCF/Envoy project). ([CNCF][7])
* Enable **caching for static paths** (`/_next/static/*`, `/images/*`, `/fonts/*`) in Envoy or via a dedicated Varnish/ATS layer.
* Keep GitOps (ArgoCD) for the whole thing.

This is almost your current Option C but with:

* Better performance via caching and tuning.
* No new proprietary components.
* Fully portable between clouds.

### OSS-aligned Option 2 – Static marketing, but cloud-agnostic

Instead of “Azure Static Web Apps”:

* Do static export for `www-ameide` if/when it makes sense.
* Host static files on **generic object storage** + an OSS gateway:

  * e.g. MinIO / Ceph behind Envoy / Nginx / Varnish.
* Put that behind the **same Envoy Gateway / OSS edge** you use for the app.

Now “marketing site independence” is achieved with:

* Next.js + git + Kubernetes + OSS edge,
* Not Azure-specific build + routing semantics.

### OSS-aligned stance on Azure Front Door / Static Web Apps

Open-source communities wouldn’t say “never use a cloud CDN”; they’d say:

* If you use something like Front Door or a commercial CDN:

  * Treat it as a **thin, easily replaceable edge**:

    * Static caching.
    * Basic TLS.
    * Maybe WAF, but only with rules you can export/re-implement elsewhere.
  * Don’t bake business logic, auth flows, or data storage into it.
* Keep your **core logic, data, and observability** in OSS projects with neutral governance (CNCF/LF). ([CNCF][1])

That way, if you ever want to drop Front Door for Cloudflare, Fastly, or self-hosted Envoy/Varnish, you can.

---

## 5. So what would they *actually* tell you to do?

If you asked a typical CNCF / Linux Foundation crowd, I think you’d hear something like:

1. **You’re already on the right track.**

   * Kubernetes, Envoy, Argo, OpenTelemetry, Keycloak, Postgres, Redis – this is a very CNCF-shaped stack.

2. **Don’t rush into Azure-specific web frontends unless there’s a killer reason.**

   * If you do use Front Door or Static Web Apps, keep them at the edges and avoid provider-specific features you can’t reproduce elsewhere.

3. **First step: solve performance with OSS you already know.**

   * Tune Envoy/Envoy Gateway as OSS ingress and add a Varnish/ATS caching tier if needed.
   * That gives you a “CDN-ish” setup with no new lock-in.

4. **If you go static for marketing, make it cloud-agnostic.**

   * Static export to generic object storage.
   * Fronted by an OSS proxy/CDN component.
   * Keep CI/CD and routing definitions in Git & K8s, not in a proprietary web UI.

If you’d like, I can sketch a very concrete “CNCF-style” reference diagram for your case (with Envoy Gateway + Varnish + Keycloak + Next.js) so you have a vendor-neutral counterpart to the Azure architecture diagram you already wrote.

# 438 – cert-manager DNS-01 with Azure Workload Identity

**Updated**: 2025-12-05

## Overview

This document describes the configuration and troubleshooting for cert-manager DNS-01 challenges using Azure DNS and Azure Workload Identity. This setup enables automated TLS certificate issuance for `*.dev.ameide.io` (and other child zones) via Let's Encrypt without storing Azure credentials in Kubernetes Secrets.

### Domain and Certificate Matrix

Per [434](434-unified-environment-naming.md#appendix-certificate--gateway-architecture):

| Environment | DNS Zone | Issuer | Certificate |
|-------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| dev | `dev.ameide.io` | `letsencrypt-dev-dns01` (Issuer) | `ameide-wildcard-dev` |
| staging | `staging.ameide.io` | `letsencrypt-staging-dns01` (Issuer) | `ameide-wildcard-staging` |
| production | `ameide.io` | `letsencrypt-prod-dns01` (Issuer) | `ameide-wildcard-prod` |
| ArgoCD (cluster) | `ameide.io` | `letsencrypt-argocd` (ClusterIssuer) | `argocd-ameide-io` |

**Key decisions:**
- Production uses apex domain (`ameide.io`) directly — there is NO `prod.ameide.io`
- ArgoCD uses ClusterIssuer for `argocd.ameide.io` (cluster-level, processed by argocd-cert-manager)
- **Environment issuers use namespaced Issuer** (not ClusterIssuer) for multi-identity architecture
- Each environment has its own cert-manager instance with isolated Workload Identity (see [448](448-cert-manager-workload-identity.md))

## Architecture

### Multi-Identity Per-Environment Architecture

Each environment (dev, staging, prod) has its own:
1. **Managed Identity** in Azure (e.g., `ameide-dns-dev-mi`, `ameide-dns-staging-mi`, `ameide-dns-prod-mi`)
2. **Federated Credential** for its ServiceAccount (e.g., `system:serviceaccount:ameide-dev:cert-manager-dev`)
3. **cert-manager instance** in its namespace (namespace-scoped with `--namespace=$(POD_NAMESPACE)`)
4. **Namespaced Issuer** (not ClusterIssuer) for DNS-01 challenges
5. **Unique ClusterRoles/ClusterRoleBindings** via per-env `fullnameOverride` (e.g., `cert-manager-dev`)

### Why Issuer Instead of ClusterIssuer

Per [448](448-cert-manager-workload-identity.md), we use namespaced Issuers because:
- Each environment has its own cert-manager instance with isolated Workload Identity
- ClusterIssuer requires a single controller to process challenges from all environments
- That single controller's ServiceAccount would need access to all per-env managed identities
- Namespaced Issuer + `--issuer-ambient-credentials=true` allows each env's controller to use its own identity

## Bicep/Terraform Infrastructure

### Per-Environment DNS Identity Module

Each environment has its own managed identity with federated credentials. Defined in:
- `infra/bicep/managed-application/modules/dnsIdentity.bicep` (creates 4 identities)
- `infra/terraform/azure/main.tf` (outputs `dns_identity_client_ids`)

Key resources per environment:
1. **User-Assigned Managed Identity** (e.g., `ameide-dns-dev-mi`, `ameide-dns-prod-mi`)
2. **Federated Identity Credential** for that environment's ServiceAccount
3. **DNS Zone Contributor role** on the environment's DNS zone

### Critical Configuration Points

```bicep
// dnsIdentity.bicep creates 4 identities with per-env SA names:
var dnsIdentities = [
  { name: 'ameide-dns-argocd-mi', zone: 'ameide.io', namespace: 'argocd', sa: 'argocd-cert-manager' }
  { name: 'ameide-dns-dev-mi', zone: 'dev.ameide.io', namespace: 'ameide-dev', sa: 'cert-manager-dev' }
  { name: 'ameide-dns-staging-mi', zone: 'staging.ameide.io', namespace: 'ameide-staging', sa: 'cert-manager-staging' }
  { name: 'ameide-dns-prod-mi', zone: 'ameide.io', namespace: 'ameide-prod', sa: 'cert-manager-prod' }
]
```

Each federated identity credential binds:
- **Issuer**: AKS OIDC issuer URL
- **Subject**: `system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:cert-manager-<env>` (per-env naming for RBAC isolation)
- **Audience**: `api://AzureADTokenExchange`

### Data Flow

```
Terraform → sync-globals.sh → globals.yaml → cert-manager-wi chart → ServiceAccount annotation
```

The client ID flows from infrastructure to Kubernetes via:
1. Terraform outputs `dns_identity_client_ids` map
2. `sync-globals.sh` writes to `sources/values/<env>/globals.yaml`
3. `foundation-cert-manager-wi` chart reads `azure.dnsManagedIdentityClientId` from globals
4. Creates ServiceAccount with `azure.workload.identity/client-id` annotation

## Helm Values Configuration

### Shared values (all environments)

File: `sources/values/_shared/foundation/foundation-cert-manager.yaml`

```yaml
# CRDs installed separately by foundation-crds-cert-manager
installCRDs: false
crds:
  enabled: false
  keep: true

# DNS-01 challenge propagation check configuration
dns01RecursiveNameservers: "8.8.8.8:53,1.1.1.1:53"
dns01RecursiveNameserversOnly: true

# Namespace-scoped watching for environment isolation
extraArgs:
  - --namespace=$(POD_NAMESPACE)
  - --enable-certificate-owner-ref=true
  - --issuer-ambient-credentials=true  # Required for WI with Issuers

# Azure Workload Identity labels
podLabels:
  azure.workload.identity/use: "true"

# ServiceAccounts managed externally by cert-manager-wi chart
# Names set per-environment: cert-manager-dev, cert-manager-staging, cert-manager-prod
```

### Per-environment values (dev example)

File: `sources/values/dev/foundation/foundation-cert-manager.yaml`

```yaml
# Per-environment naming for complete RBAC isolation
# Each environment gets unique ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings
fullnameOverride: cert-manager-dev

# ServiceAccount matches the fullnameOverride for RBAC binding
serviceAccount:
  create: false
  name: cert-manager-dev
```

### ServiceAccount Management

ServiceAccounts are managed by the `foundation-cert-manager-wi` chart (see [448](448-cert-manager-workload-identity.md)):
- Reads client ID from `globals.yaml` (`azure.dnsManagedIdentityClientId`)
- Creates ServiceAccount with proper WI annotations
- Deployed at rolloutPhase 115 (before cert-manager at 120)

### Per-environment values (dev)

File: `sources/values/dev/platform/platform-cert-manager-config.yaml`

```yaml
certManager:
  enabled: true
  issuers:
    letsencrypt:
      dns01:
        enabled: true
        kind: Issuer  # Not ClusterIssuer
        name: letsencrypt-dev-dns01
        provider:
          azureDNS:
            hostedZoneName: "{{ .Values.azure.dnsZone }}"
            managedIdentity:
              clientID: "{{ .Values.azure.dnsManagedIdentityClientId }}"

  certificates:
    - name: ameide-wildcard-dev
      issuer: letsencrypt-dev-dns01
      issuerKind: Issuer  # Match the Issuer kind
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. DNS propagation check fails continuously

**Symptom:**
```
propagation check failed: DNS record for "dev.ameide.io" not yet propagated
```

**Cause:** cert-manager's default DNS check uses local/authoritative nameservers which may not reflect recent changes quickly.

**Fix:** Add recursive DNS nameservers to cert-manager:
```yaml
dns01RecursiveNameservers: "8.8.8.8:53,1.1.1.1:53"
dns01RecursiveNameserversOnly: true
```

Verify the setting is active:
```bash
# Per-environment deployments (use appropriate namespace)
kubectl logs deployment/cert-manager-dev -n ameide-dev | grep "configured acme dns01 nameservers"
kubectl logs deployment/cert-manager-staging -n ameide-staging | grep "configured acme dns01 nameservers"
kubectl logs deployment/cert-manager-prod -n ameide-prod | grep "configured acme dns01 nameservers"
# Should show: nameservers=["8.8.8.8:53","1.1.1.1:53"]
```

#### 2. 400 Bad Request from Azure AD Token Exchange

**Symptom:**
```
authentication failed:
POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/oauth2/v2.0/token
RESPONSE 400 Bad Request
```

**Causes:**
- Federated identity credential doesn't exist for this namespace/ServiceAccount combination
- Subject mismatch between Kubernetes SA and Azure federated credential

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check federated credentials on the per-env managed identity
az identity federated-credential list \
  --identity-name ameide-dns-prod-mi \
  --resource-group Ameide

# The subject should be: system:serviceaccount:ameide-prod:cert-manager-prod
# Verify service account annotations
kubectl get sa cert-manager-prod -n ameide-prod -o yaml

# Check WI env vars are injected into the pod
kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=cert-manager-prod -n ameide-prod \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.containers[0].env}' | jq .
```

**Fix:** Create the federated credential in Azure for the correct namespace:
```bash
az identity federated-credential create \
  --name "ameide-prod-cert-manager" \
  --identity-name "ameide-dns-prod-mi" \
  --resource-group "Ameide" \
  --issuer "<aks-oidc-issuer-url>" \
  --subject "system:serviceaccount:ameide-prod:cert-manager-prod" \
  --audience "api://AzureADTokenExchange"
```

#### 3. 401 Unauthorized from Azure AD

**Symptom:**
```
Error presenting challenge: authentication failed:
POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/oauth2/v2.0/token
RESPONSE 401 Unauthorized
```

**Causes:**
- Federated identity credential expired or revoked
- AKS OIDC issuer URL changed
- Missing `azure.workload.identity/use: "true"` labels/annotations

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check federated credentials on the managed identity
az identity federated-credential list \
  --identity-name ameide-dns-dev-mi \
  --resource-group Ameide

# Verify service account annotations
kubectl get sa cert-manager-dev -n ameide-dev -o yaml
```

**Fix:** Verify federated credential configuration matches the AKS OIDC issuer.

#### 4. 403 Forbidden on Azure DNS

**Symptom:**
```
Error presenting challenge: request error:
GET https://management.azure.com/.../dnsZones/dev.ameide.io/TXT/_acme-challenge
RESPONSE 403 Forbidden
ERROR CODE: AuthorizationFailed
```

**Causes:**
- DNS Zone Contributor role not assigned on the child zone
- Role assigned only on parent zone, not child zones

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check role assignments on the child zone
az role assignment list \
  --scope "/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/Ameide/providers/Microsoft.Network/dnsZones/dev.ameide.io" \
  --query "[?principalType=='ServicePrincipal'].{role:roleDefinitionName, principal:principalId}"
```

**Fix:** The `dnsIdentity.bicep` module includes `childZoneRoleAssignment` for each child zone. Verify it deployed:
```bash
az deployment operation group list \
  --resource-group Ameide \
  --name dnsIdentity \
  --query "[?contains(properties.targetResource.resourceName, 'dns-identity-access')].{name:properties.targetResource.resourceName, status:properties.provisioningState}"
```

#### 4. ClusterIssuer shows "No ClientID found"

**Symptom:**
```
No ClientID found: attempting to authenticate with ambient credentials
```

**Cause:** The ClusterIssuer doesn't have `managedIdentity.clientID` set.

**Fix:** Update the ClusterIssuer spec:
```yaml
spec:
  acme:
    solvers:
    - dns01:
        azureDNS:
          managedIdentity:
            clientID: "<dns-mi-client-id>"  # Must be present
```

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Check certificate status
kubectl get certificate -n ameide
kubectl describe certificate ameide-wildcard-dev -n ameide

# Check challenges
kubectl get challenges -A
kubectl describe challenge <name> -n ameide

# Check cert-manager logs (per-environment)
kubectl logs deployment/cert-manager-dev -n ameide-dev --tail=50
kubectl logs deployment/cert-manager-staging -n ameide-staging --tail=50
kubectl logs deployment/cert-manager-prod -n ameide-prod --tail=50

# Verify DNS record exists
dig @8.8.8.8 TXT _acme-challenge.dev.ameide.io +short

# Test Azure DNS access from inside cluster
kubectl run dns-test --rm -it --image=mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli -- \
  az login --federated-token "$(cat /var/run/secrets/azure/tokens/azure-identity-token)" \
  --service-principal -u <client-id> -t <tenant-id>
```

### Recovery Procedure

If certificate issuance is stuck:

1. **Delete the stuck certificate** (cert-manager will recreate):
   ```bash
   kubectl delete certificate ameide-wildcard-dev -n ameide
   ```

2. **Wait for new challenge** and monitor:
   ```bash
   kubectl get challenges -A -w
   ```

3. **Check for errors**:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe challenge <new-challenge-name> -n ameide
   ```

4. **Force cert-manager restart** if configuration changed:
   ```bash
   # Restart per-environment deployments
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/cert-manager-dev -n ameide-dev
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/cert-manager-staging -n ameide-staging
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/cert-manager-prod -n ameide-prod
   ```

## Deployment Modes

The same Bicep + bootstrap stack supports three deployment modes corresponding to the tenancy models defined in [443-tenancy-models.md](443-tenancy-models.md):

| Mode | Description | Bicep Usage | Subscription |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Shared SaaS** | Single multi-tenant cluster `ameide` per region | `deploy-managed-app.sh staging/production` | AMEIDE subscription |
| **Namespace-per-tenant** | Tenants share the regional `ameide` cluster | No new AKS; GitOps creates `tenant-<id>-prod` namespaces | AMEIDE subscription |
| **Private cloud (per-tenant)** | Dedicated cluster per tenant (optionally in their subscription) | `deploy-managed-app.sh` with tenant-specific params | Customer subscription |

### Shared SaaS Deployment

Standard deployment for internal environments:
```bash
./scripts/deploy-managed-app.sh staging
./scripts/deploy-managed-app.sh production
```

### Namespace-per-Tenant Deployment

No infrastructure changes required. See [GitOps: Tenants on a Shared Cluster](#gitops-tenants-on-a-shared-cluster) below.

### Private Cloud Deployment

For dedicated tenant clusters, use tenant-specific parameters:
```bash
./scripts/deploy-managed-app.sh production \
  --deployment-mode privateTenant \
  --tenant-slug acme \
  --resource-group Ameide-Acme
```

> **Private cloud note**: For `deploymentMode=privateTenant`, deployment typically occurs in the
> customer's Azure subscription using Azure Managed Applications.
> See [148-azure-managed-offering.md](148-azure-managed-offering.md) for Marketplace packaging.

### GitOps: Tenants on a Shared Cluster

For namespace-per-tenant deployments, we **do not** run Bicep again. Instead:

1. **Create a namespace per tenant** (e.g., `tenant-acme-prod`) with labels:
   ```yaml
   metadata:
     name: tenant-acme-prod
     labels:
       ameide.io/environment: production
       ameide.io/tenant-kind: namespace
       ameide.io/tenant-id: acme
   ```

2. **Extend the ApplicationSet** `argocd/applicationsets/ameide.yaml` `list` generator with a new element:
   ```yaml
   - env: production
     tenantKind: namespace
     tenantId: acme
     namespace: tenant-acme-prod
   ```

3. **Add per-tenant values** under `sources/values/tenants/acme/...`:
   ```
   sources/values/tenants/
   └── acme/
       ├── globals.yaml        # Tenant-specific config
       └── apps/               # Tenant-specific overrides
   ```

This keeps infrastructure provisioning (Bicep) and per-tenant workloads (GitOps) cleanly separated.

> **Reference:** See [443-tenancy-models.md](443-tenancy-models.md) for complete tenancy documentation.

### modules/dnsIdentity.bicep

**Purpose:** Managed identity for cert-manager DNS-01 challenges with workload identity federation.

**Resources Created:**
1. User-assigned managed identity (`ameide-dns-mi`)
2. Federated identity credential for cert-manager service account
3. DNS Zone Contributor role on parent and child zones
4. Child DNS zones (dev.ameide.io, staging.ameide.io)
5. NS delegation records

**Cross-reference:** See [438-cert-manager-dns01-azure-workload-identity.md](438-cert-manager-dns01-azure-workload-identity.md) for detailed architecture.

### modules/keyvault.bicep

**Purpose:** Key Vault with RBAC authorization and diagnostics.

**Key Configuration:**
- RBAC authorization (no access policies)
- Purge protection enabled (90-day soft-delete)
- Diagnostic settings: AuditEvent logs + AllMetrics
- SKU: standard (staging) / premium (production)

## Scripts Reference

### deploy-managed-app.sh

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-managed-app.sh <env> [deployment-name]
```

**Parameters:**
- `<env>`: Environment (`dev`, `staging`, `production`)
- `[deployment-name]`: Optional Azure deployment name override

**Environment Variables:**
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (required): GitHub token for GitOps repo access
- `AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP` (optional): Resource group (default: Ameide)
- `AMEIDE_SP_PROFILE` (optional): Service principal profile for CI/CD

**Operations:**
1. Validates Azure CLI authentication
2. Ensures AKS admin SSH key exists
3. Parses .env files for Key Vault secrets
4. Handles soft-deleted Key Vault recovery
5. Executes Bicep deployment
6. Captures outputs to JSON
7. Updates globals.yaml
8. Refreshes kubectl context

### setup-service-principal.sh

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/setup-service-principal.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `Key Vault soft-deleted` | Previous deployment deleted vault | Script auto-recovers or purges |
| `OIDC issuer not found` | AKS not fully provisioned | Wait for AKS to be Running state |
| `DNS challenge failed` | Federated identity not configured | Check dnsIdentity.bicep outputs |
| `Image pull failed` | ACR not attached or no GHCR token | Verify imagePullSecrets and ACR role |

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check AKS OIDC issuer
az aks show --name ameide --resource-group Ameide --query oidcIssuerProfile

# Check Key Vault access
az keyvault secret list --vault-name <vault-name>

# Check DNS zone delegation
dig NS dev.ameide.io

# Check cert-manager logs
kubectl -n cert-manager logs -l app=cert-manager

# Check ArgoCD sync status
argocd app get <app-name> --show-operation
```

## Implementation Status (2025-12-04)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Premium storage class** | ✅ Done | PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, Kafka updated to `managed-csi-premium` |
| **Kafka persistent storage** | ✅ Done | Template updated with configurable persistent-claim storage |
| **CNPG backups Bicep** | ✅ Done | `storageAccount.bicep`, `backupIdentity.bicep` modules created |
| **CNPG backups Terraform** | ✅ Done | Backup modules created in `modules/azure-identity/` |
| **IaC backup output parity** | ✅ Done | `backup_storage_account_name`, `backup_identity_client_id` in both Bicep & Terraform |
| **CNPG backups deployment** | ⏳ Pending | Run Bicep/Terraform with `enableBackupStorage=true`, then enable in CNPG values |
| **Node affinity (data tier)** | ⏳ Blocked | Waiting for node pools from 442 |

> **Consistency testing**: Run `./infra/scripts/test-iac-consistency.sh schema` to verify Bicep and Terraform output parity.

## Problem Statement

Current storage configuration has several concerns that need to be addressed for production readiness:

1. **Kafka ephemeral storage**: Data loss on pod restart
2. **No backup strategy**: No CNPG scheduled backups or Velero configured
3. **Single storage tier**: No differentiation between performance tiers (premium vs standard)
4. **No data-tier node affinity**: Data workloads not pinned to appropriate node pools

## Current State (Verified 2025-12-04)

### AKS Cluster Storage

The cluster runs on **Azure Kubernetes Service** with native Azure Disk CSI driver:

```bash
# Actual cluster configuration
az aks show --name ameide --resource-group Ameide
# Location: westeurope
# Kubernetes: 1.32.7
# Node SKU: Standard_D8as_v6 (8 vCPU, 32Gi RAM)
```

### StorageClass Configuration

AKS provides built-in storage classes with Azure Disk CSI:

| StorageClass | Provisioner | SKU | Expansion | Status |
|--------------|-------------|-----|-----------|--------|
| `managed-csi` | disk.csi.azure.com | StandardSSD_LRS | ✅ Yes | Default |
| `managed-csi-premium` | disk.csi.azure.com | Premium_LRS | ✅ Yes | Available |
| `azurefile-csi` | file.csi.azure.com | Standard_LRS | ✅ Yes | Available |

> **Note**: The local `storageclass-managed-csi.yaml` file in the repo is a **fallback for k3d local development** only. On AKS, the Azure-managed classes take precedence.

### Storage by Component

| Component | Storage Class | Dev | Staging | Production | Issues |
|-----------|--------------|-----|---------|------------|--------|
| PostgreSQL CNPG | managed-csi-premium | 10Gi | 10Gi | 200Gi | Backup config ready, needs Azure SA |
| Redis Failover | managed-csi-premium | 8Gi | 8Gi | 8Gi | ✅ |
| Kafka (Strimzi) | managed-csi-premium | 20Gi | 20Gi | 20Gi | ✅ Persistent storage configured |
| ClickHouse | managed-csi-premium | 20Gi | 20Gi | 50Gi | ✅ |
| MinIO | managed-csi | disabled | 50Gi | 100Gi | ✅ (standard OK for bulk) |
| Tempo | managed-csi | 10Gi | 10Gi | 50Gi | ✅ (standard OK for bulk) |
| Loki | S3 (MinIO) | - | - | - | Depends on MinIO |
| Prometheus | managed-csi | 50Gi | 50Gi | 100Gi | ✅ (standard OK for bulk) |

### Storage Tier Recommendations

| Workload Type | Recommended StorageClass | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| PostgreSQL, ClickHouse | `managed-csi-premium` | IOPS-sensitive, low latency |
| Kafka, Redis | `managed-csi-premium` | Write-heavy, throughput |
| MinIO, Tempo, Loki | `managed-csi` (standard) | Bulk storage, cost-sensitive |
| Prometheus | `managed-csi` | Retention-based, moderate IOPS |

### Tenancy-aware Data Isolation

Storage strategy differs by tenancy model (see [443-tenancy-models.md](443-tenancy-models.md)):

| Tenancy Model | Database Strategy | Object Storage Strategy | Cost/Complexity |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Shared SaaS | Single CNPG cluster, multi-tenant schema | Shared MinIO/Azure Blob with tenant prefix | Low |
| Namespace-per-tenant | Shared CNPG cluster, separate databases per tenant | Shared MinIO/Azure Blob, `/<tenant-id>/…` prefix | Medium |
| Namespace-per-tenant (premium) | Dedicated CNPG cluster per namespace | Shared MinIO/Azure Blob, `/<tenant-id>/…` prefix | High |
| Private cloud | Dedicated CNPG cluster per tenant cluster | Dedicated Storage Account per tenant | Per-tenant |

> **Default recommendation**: Shared CNPG cluster with separate databases per tenant. Row-level security optional.

**Naming conventions for tenant isolation:**

- Every PVC name SHOULD include environment and tenant (where applicable):
  - `pgdata-<env>-<tenant-id>-<service>` (e.g., `pgdata-prod-acme-platform`)
- CNPG database names MUST include tenant id for namespace-per-tenant:
  - `ameide_<tenant-id>` (e.g., `ameide_acme`)
- MinIO bucket prefixes MUST include tenant id for namespace-per-tenant and private cloud:
  - `ameide/<env>/<tenant-id>/postgres/…`
  - `ameide/<env>/<tenant-id>/minio/…`

**Example: Namespace-per-tenant PostgreSQL**

```yaml
# sources/values/tenants/acme/data/platform-postgres-clusters.yaml
cluster:
  name: postgres-tenant-acme
  storage:
    storageClass: managed-csi-premium
    size: 50Gi
  backup:
    barmanObjectStore:
      destinationPath: "s3://ameide-backups/production/acme/postgres/"
```

### Key Files

- `sources/values/_shared/data/data-redis-failover.yaml`
- `sources/values/_shared/data/data-clickhouse.yaml`

---

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Use Premium Storage for Data-Tier Workloads

**Priority**: HIGH

AKS already provides `managed-csi-premium`. Update data workloads to use it:

**File**: `sources/values/_shared/data/platform-postgres-clusters.yaml`

```yaml
cluster:
  storage:
    storageClass: managed-csi-premium  # Changed from managed-csi
    size: 10Gi  # Dev default, overridden per-env
```

**File**: `sources/values/production/data/platform-postgres-clusters.yaml`

```yaml
cluster:
  storage:
    storageClass: managed-csi-premium
    size: 200Gi
```

### 2. Add Data-Tier Node Affinity

**Priority**: MEDIUM

When node pools are implemented (see [442-environment-isolation.md](442-environment-isolation.md)), pin data workloads to the appropriate environment pool:

```yaml
# For StatefulSets (PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis)
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        ameide.io/pool: prod  # From globals.yaml
      tolerations:
        - key: "ameide.io/environment"
          value: "production"
          effect: "NoSchedule"
```

> **Note**: This depends on node pool strategy defined in 442. Initially, all workloads share the same pool.

**Tenant node affinity:**

When node pools from 442 are deployed, all data-tier StatefulSets SHOULD use `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` that target the environment pool (`prod`, `staging`, `dev`), regardless of tenant.

- **Shared SaaS**: Data workloads run on environment pool (e.g., `prod` pool)
- **Namespace-per-tenant**: Tenant data workloads (`tenant-acme-prod`) run on `prod` pool alongside shared SaaS
- **Private cloud**: Tenant cluster has its own 4-pool strategy

Tenants are isolated via namespaces and PVC/database naming, not dedicated data pools by default. Large tenants MAY receive dedicated data pools as a premium option (extension of the 4-pool strategy).

### 3. Enable Kafka Persistent Storage

**Priority**: HIGH

Update Kafka to use persistent storage:

**File**: `sources/charts/foundation/operators-config/kafka_cluster/templates/kafka.yaml`

```yaml
# Change from:
storage:
  type: ephemeral

# To:
storage:
  type: persistent-claim
  size: 20Gi
  class: managed-csi-premium
  deleteClaim: false
```

**File**: `sources/values/_shared/data/data-kafka-cluster.yaml`

```yaml
kafka:
  storage:
    type: persistent-claim
    size: 20Gi
    class: managed-csi-premium
    deleteClaim: false
```

### 4. Implement CNPG Backup Strategy

**Priority**: HIGH

Enable scheduled backups for PostgreSQL:

**File**: `sources/values/_shared/data/platform-postgres-clusters.yaml`

```yaml
cluster:
  backup:
    barmanObjectStore:
      destinationPath: "s3://ameide-backups/postgres/"
      endpointURL: "https://ameidesa.blob.core.windows.net"
      s3Credentials:
        accessKeyId:
          name: azure-backup-credentials
          key: accessKeyId
        secretAccessKey:
          name: azure-backup-credentials
          key: secretAccessKey
      wal:
        compression: gzip
        maxParallel: 2
    retentionPolicy: "7d"

  # Scheduled backups
  scheduledBackups:
    - name: daily-backup
      schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # 2 AM daily
      backupOwnerReference: self
      method: barmanObjectStore
```

### 5. Consider Velero for Cluster Backup

**Priority**: LOW (Future)

For full cluster disaster recovery:

```yaml
# velero-values.yaml
configuration:
  provider: azure
  backupStorageLocation:
    bucket: velero-backups
    config:
      resourceGroup: Ameide
      storageAccount: ameidesa
  volumeSnapshotLocation:
    config:
      resourceGroup: Ameide
schedules:
  daily:
    schedule: "0 3 * * *"
    template:
      ttl: "168h"  # 7 days
```

---

## Migration Considerations

### StorageClass Change

1. **New PVCs only**: Existing PVCs cannot change StorageClass
2. **Data migration**: May need to backup/restore for existing volumes
3. **Test in dev**: Validate Azure Disk performance before production

### Kafka Migration

1. **Data loss acceptable**: Current ephemeral means no data anyway
2. **Size calculation**: Monitor topic sizes before setting PVC size
3. **Replication factor**: Consider increasing replicas with persistent storage

---

## Implementation Status (2025-12-04)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Namespace labels** | ✅ Done | `ameide.io/environment` + tenant labels added to `foundation-namespaces.yaml` |
| **Tier labels (values)** | ✅ Done | `tier` field added to all app/data/platform values |
| **Tier labels (pods)** | ✅ Done | `tierLabels` helper added to all 12 app charts |
| **Cross-env NetworkPolicy** | ✅ Done | `deny-cross-environment` policy in `foundation-namespaces.yaml` |
| **nodeSelector/tolerations** | ✅ Done | Added to all app deployment templates |
| **Tier-based NetworkPolicy** | ✅ Done | `tier-based-ingress` policy in `foundation-namespaces.yaml` |
| **Cross-tenant NetworkPolicy** | ✅ Done | `deny-cross-tenant` policy in `foundation-namespaces.yaml` (conditional) |
| **Rate limiting template** | ✅ Done | `rate-limit-policy.yaml` with auth & global policies |
| **Rate limiting values** | ✅ Done | Values added to `_shared/platform/platform-gateway.yaml` |

## Problem Statement

Current networking configuration lacks several production-ready features:

1. **No cross-environment isolation**: Traffic can flow between dev/staging/prod namespaces
2. **No tier-based traffic flow**: No enforcement of frontend→backend→data flow
3. **No rate limiting**: Gateway accepts unlimited requests
4. **Missing namespace labels**: Required for NetworkPolicy selectors
5. **Component-only policies**: Existing policies (minio, keycloak, kafka) don't enforce architecture

## Current State (Verified 2025-12-04)

### Gateway Architecture

- **Gateway Controller**: Envoy Gateway v1.6.0 (runs in `argocd` namespace)
- **API Version**: Kubernetes Gateway API
- **TLS**: cert-manager with wildcard certificates per environment
- **Load Balancer**: Azure Standard LB with static public IPs per environment
- **HTTP Redirect**: Consolidated into main gateway HTTP listener (see [457](457-azure-lb-redirect-gateway-consolidation.md))

### EnvoyProxy Per-Environment Architecture

Each environment has its own EnvoyProxy resource with a dedicated static IP from Terraform:

| Environment | EnvoyProxy | Namespace | Static IP | Azure Resource |
|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| dev | ameide-proxy-config | ameide-dev | 40.68.113.216 | ameide-dev-envoy-pip |
| staging | ameide-proxy-config | ameide-staging | 108.142.228.7 | ameide-staging-envoy-pip |
| production | ameide-proxy-config | ameide-prod | 4.180.130.190 | ameide-prod-envoy-pip |
| argocd (cluster) | cluster-proxy-config | argocd | 20.160.216.7 | ameide-argocd-pip |

Configuration files:
- Per-env static IPs: `sources/values/{dev,staging,production}/platform/platform-gateway.yaml`
- Cluster gateway: `sources/charts/cluster/gateway/values.yaml`
- EnvoyProxy template: `sources/charts/apps/gateway/templates/envoyproxy-telemetry.yaml`

### Tenant Routing Patterns

Domain routing differs by tenancy model (see [443-tenancy-models.md](443-tenancy-models.md)):

| Tenancy Model | Domain Pattern | HTTPRoute Target Namespace |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Shared SaaS | `*.ameide.io` | `ameide-prod` |
| Namespace-per-tenant | `*.<tenant>.ameide.io` | `tenant-<tenant>-prod` |
| Namespace-per-tenant | Custom domain (CNAME) | `tenant-<tenant>-prod` |
| Private cloud | `*.ameide-<tenant>.io` | `ameide-prod` (in tenant cluster) |
| Private cloud | Custom domain | `ameide-prod` (in tenant cluster) |

**HTTPRoute example for namespace-per-tenant:**

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: tenant-acme-platform
  namespace: tenant-acme-prod
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: ameide
      namespace: envoy-gateway-system
  hostnames:
    - "platform.acme.ameide.io"
    - "api.acme.ameide.io"
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
      backendRefs:
        - name: platform
          namespace: tenant-acme-prod
          port: 8080
```

All tenancy models reuse the same Gateway + HTTPRoute patterns; only hostnames and target namespaces change.

### Existing Gateway Policies

**File**: `sources/charts/apps/gateway/templates/`

| Policy Type | Purpose | Status |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| BackendTrafficPolicy | Timeouts, retries | ✅ Configured |
| ClientTrafficPolicy | X-Forwarded-For | ✅ Configured |
| SecurityPolicy | CORS | ✅ Configured |
| EnvoyPatchPolicy | TLS settings | ✅ Configured |
| Rate Limiting | Request throttling | ✅ Configured (`rate-limit-policy.yaml`) |

### Existing Network Policies

```bash
kubectl get networkpolicies -A
```

| Namespace | Policy | Scope | Gap |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----|
| ameide-dev | `data-minio` | MinIO pods | Component-only |
| ameide-dev | `keycloak-network-policy` | Keycloak pods | Component-only |
| ameide-staging | `kafka-network-policy-kafka` | Kafka pods | Component-only |
| argocd | `argocd-*-network-policy` | ArgoCD components | ✅ Good |

**Implemented policies (2025-12-04):**
- ✅ Cross-environment isolation (`deny-cross-environment` in `foundation-namespaces.yaml`)
- ✅ Tier-based flow enforcement (`tier-based-ingress` in `foundation-namespaces.yaml`)
- ⏳ Default deny ingress per namespace (not yet implemented - consider carefully as it's restrictive)

### Namespace Labels (Implemented 2025-12-04)

Labels configured in `sources/values/_shared/foundation/foundation-namespaces.yaml`:

| Namespace | `ameide.io/environment` | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| ameide-dev | `dev` | Via `{{ .Values.environment }}` |
| ameide-staging | `staging` | Via `{{ .Values.environment }}` |
| ameide-prod | `production` | Via `{{ .Values.environment }}` |
| argocd | `cluster` | Explicit label |
| cert-manager | `cluster` | Explicit label |
| cnpg-system | `cluster` | Explicit label |
| strimzi-system | `cluster` | Explicit label |

> **Note**: Pod tier labels (`ameide.io/tier`) are applied via `tierLabels` helper in deployment templates,
> not namespace labels. Tier values come from `tier:` field in app values files.

### Tenant Labels (Required for Multi-Tenancy)

Namespaces and pods MUST also carry tenant labels for cross-tenant isolation (see [443-tenancy-models.md](443-tenancy-models.md)):

| Label | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `ameide.io/tenant-kind` | `shared`, `namespace`, `private` | Tenancy model |
| `ameide.io/tenant-id` | `<tenant-slug>` | Tenant identifier (omit for shared) |

**Examples:**

Shared SaaS namespace:
```yaml
# ameide-prod
metadata:
  labels:
    ameide.io/environment: production
    ameide.io/tenant-kind: shared
    # No tenant-id for shared
```

Namespace-per-tenant:
```yaml
# tenant-acme-prod
metadata:
  labels:

## Proposed Changes

### 0. Add Namespace Labels (Prerequisite)

**Priority**: HIGH (Blocker for all NetworkPolicies)

Add labels to namespaces via the namespace Helm chart:

**File**: `sources/charts/foundation/namespaces/templates/namespace.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.namespace }}
  labels:
    ameide.io/environment: {{ .Values.environment }}
    ameide.io/managed-by: gitops
    kubernetes.io/metadata.name: {{ .Values.namespace }}
```

**Required labels per namespace:**

| Namespace | `ameide.io/environment` | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| ameide-dev | `dev` | Development workloads |
| ameide-staging | `staging` | Staging workloads |
| ameide-prod | `production` | Production workloads |
| argocd | `cluster` | Cluster-scoped, allowed everywhere |

---

### 1. Cross-Environment Isolation

**Priority**: HIGH

Block all traffic between environment namespaces:

**File**: `sources/charts/foundation/common/templates/networkpolicy-cross-env-deny.yaml`

```yaml
{{- range $env := list "dev" "staging" "production" }}
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-cross-env-ingress
  namespace: ameide-{{ $env }}
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    # Allow from same environment namespace
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              ameide.io/environment: {{ $env }}
    # Allow from cluster-scoped namespaces (argocd, cert-manager)
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              ameide.io/environment: cluster
    # Allow from kube-system (metrics, DNS)
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system
{{- end }}
```

**Traffic matrix after policy:**

| Source → Dest | ameide-dev | ameide-staging | ameide-prod |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| ameide-dev | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| ameide-staging | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| ameide-prod | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| argocd | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| kube-system | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

---

### 1.5 Cross-Tenant Isolation (Namespace-per-tenant) ✅

**Status**: Implemented in `foundation-namespaces.yaml` with conditional rendering

For namespace-per-tenant workloads (`tenant-*` namespaces), block traffic between different tenants:

**File**: `sources/values/_shared/foundation/foundation-namespaces.yaml` (conditional manifest)

```yaml
{{- if eq .Values.tenantKind "namespace" }}
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-cross-tenant-ingress
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}  # e.g. tenant-acme-prod
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    # Same tenant only
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              ameide.io/tenant-id: {{ .Values.tenantId }}
    # Cluster services (argocd, cert-manager, kube-system)
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              ameide.io/environment: cluster
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system
{{- end }}
```

> **Shared SaaS note**: Namespaces with `tenant-kind=shared` (e.g., `ameide-prod`) use
> application-level multi-tenancy instead of namespace isolation. This policy only
> applies to `tenant-*` namespaces.

**Cross-tenant traffic matrix:**

| Source → Dest | tenant-acme-prod | tenant-contoso-prod | ameide-prod |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| tenant-acme-prod | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| tenant-contoso-prod | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| ameide-prod | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| argocd | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| kube-system | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

---

### 2. Tier-Based Traffic Flow

**Priority**: MEDIUM

Enforce the architectural flow: `external → frontend → backend → data`

**Service tier classification** (from `component.yaml` domains):

| Tier | Services | Exposure |
|------|----------|----------|
| **frontend** | www-ameide, www-ameide-platform, plausible | External (HTTPRoute) |
| **backend** | graph, inference, platform, agents, workflows, threads | Mixed |
| **data** | postgres, redis, kafka, temporal, minio, clickhouse | Internal only |
| **platform** | keycloak, grafana, prometheus, envoy-gateway | Mixed |

**File**: `sources/charts/foundation/common/templates/networkpolicy-tier-flow.yaml`

```yaml
# Data tier: only accepts traffic from backend tier
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: data-tier-ingress
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      ameide.io/tier: data
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    # Allow from backend tier
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              ameide.io/tier: backend
    # Allow from platform tier (observability)
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              ameide.io/tier: platform
    # Allow from same tier (replication)
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              ameide.io/tier: data
```

> **Prerequisite**: Pod labels must include `ameide.io/tier`. See [442-environment-isolation.md](442-environment-isolation.md) for label propagation.

---

### 3. Add Rate Limiting at Gateway

**Priority**: MEDIUM

Create a BackendTrafficPolicy for rate limiting:

**File**: `sources/charts/apps/gateway/templates/backendtrafficpolicy-ratelimit.yaml`

```yaml
{{- if .Values.rateLimit.enabled }}
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackendTrafficPolicy
metadata:
  name: {{ include "gateway.fullname" . }}-rate-limit
  namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: {{ .Values.gateway.name | default "ameide" }}
  rateLimit:
    type: Global
    global:
      rules:
        - limit:
            requests: {{ .Values.rateLimit.requestsPerMinute | default 1000 }}
            unit: Minute
          clientSelectors:
            - headers:
                - name: X-API-Key
                  type: Distinct
{{- end }}
```

**Values configuration**:

```yaml
# sources/values/_shared/platform/platform-gateway.yaml
rateLimit:
  enabled: true
  requestsPerMinute: 1000

# sources/values/production/platform/platform-gateway.yaml
rateLimit:
  enabled: true
  requestsPerMinute: 5000  # Higher for production
```

### 2. Implement Network Policies

**Priority**: MEDIUM

#### 2.1 Default Deny Policy

**File**: `sources/charts/foundation/common/raw-manifests/files/networkpolicy-default-deny.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-ingress
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
```

#### 2.2 Data Layer Isolation

**File**: `sources/charts/foundation/common/raw-manifests/files/networkpolicy-postgres.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: postgres-ingress
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      cnpg.io/cluster: postgres-ameide
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    # Allow from same namespace only
    - from:
        - podSelector: {}
    # Allow from Prometheus for monitoring
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: {{ .Values.namespace }}
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app.kubernetes.io/name: prometheus
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 9187  # postgres exporter
```

#### 2.3 Redis Isolation

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: redis-ingress
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: redis
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector: {}
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 6379
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 26379  # Sentinel
```

#### 2.4 Kafka Isolation

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: kafka-ingress
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      strimzi.io/cluster: kafka
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector: {}
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 9092
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 9093
```

### 3. Add Health Check Standardization

**Priority**: LOW

Ensure all HTTPRoutes include health checks:

**File**: Update each HTTPRoute template

```yaml
# Add health endpoint to each route
- matches:
    - path:
        type: Exact
        value: /healthz
  backendRefs:
    - name: {{ .service.name }}
      port: {{ .service.port }}
```

**Or create a dedicated health route**:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: health-check-route
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: ameide
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /healthz
      backendRefs:
        - name: envoy-gateway
          port: 8080
```

### 4. Configure Access Logging Sampling

**Priority**: LOW

Update EnvoyPatchPolicy for log sampling:

**File**: `sources/charts/apps/gateway/templates/envoypatch-accesslog.yaml`

```yaml
{{- if .Values.accessLog.sampling.enabled }}
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: EnvoyPatchPolicy
metadata:
  name: {{ include "gateway.fullname" . }}-accesslog-sampling
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: {{ .Values.gateway.name | default "ameide" }}
  type: JSONPatch
  jsonPatches:
    - type: "type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.listener.v3.Listener"
      name: "{{ .Values.gateway.name }}/https"
      operation:
        op: add
        path: "/filter_chains/0/filters/0/typed_config/access_log/0/filter"
        value:
          runtime_filter:
            runtime_key: "access_log.sampling"
            percent_sampled:
              numerator: {{ .Values.accessLog.sampling.percent }}
              denominator: HUNDRED
{{- end }}
```

**Values**:

```yaml
# Production only - sample 10% of access logs
accessLog:
  sampling:
    enabled: true
    percent: 10
```

---

## Environment-Specific Configuration

| Setting | Dev | Staging | Production |
|---------|-----|---------|------------|
| Rate Limit | 100/min | 500/min | 5000/min |
| Network Policies | Permissive | Enforced | Enforced |
| Access Log Sampling | 100% | 50% | 10% |
| Health Check Interval | 30s | 15s | 10s |

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 0: Prerequisites (Blocker) ✅
1. [x] Add `ameide.io/environment` label to namespace Helm chart → **2025-12-04**
2. [x] Add `ameide.io/environment: cluster` to argocd, cert-manager namespaces → **2025-12-04**
3. [ ] Deploy namespace label changes via ArgoCD
4. [ ] Verify labels with `kubectl get ns --show-labels`

> **Implementation note**: Namespace labels added to `sources/values/_shared/foundation/foundation-namespaces.yaml`.
> Workload namespaces use `{{ .Values.environment }}` templating.
> Cluster-scoped namespaces labeled with `ameide.io/environment: cluster`.

### Phase 1: Cross-Environment Isolation ✅
5. [x] Create `deny-cross-env-ingress` NetworkPolicy template → **2025-12-04**
6. [ ] Deploy to dev namespace first, test ArgoCD sync still works
7. [ ] Verify dev pods cannot reach staging/prod
8. [ ] Roll out to staging and prod namespaces

> **Implementation note**: `deny-cross-environment` NetworkPolicy added to `foundation-namespaces.yaml`.
> Policy allows same-environment, cluster namespace, and kube-system traffic.

### Phase 2: Tier-Based Flow ✅
9. [x] Add `tier` field to app values files → **2025-12-04** (see 442)
10. [x] Update Helm charts to include `ameide.io/tier` label on pods → **2025-12-04**
11. [x] Create `tier-based-ingress` NetworkPolicy → **2025-12-04**
12. [ ] Test backend services can still reach data layer
13. [ ] Test frontend cannot directly reach data layer

> **Implementation note**: `tierLabels` helper added to all 12 app chart `_helpers.tpl` files.
> `tier-based-ingress` NetworkPolicy added to `foundation-namespaces.yaml`.
> Data tier only accepts from backend/platform/data tiers + cluster namespace.

### Phase 3: Gateway Policies ✅
14. [x] Create rate limiting BackendTrafficPolicy template → **2025-12-04**
15. [x] Add rate limit values per environment → **2025-12-04**
16. [ ] Add access log sampling for production

> **Implementation note**: `rate-limit-policy.yaml` template exists with auth & global policies.
> Rate limit values added to `_shared/platform/platform-gateway.yaml` and per-environment overrides.
> - Dev: 10 req/min auth, global disabled
> - Staging: 15 req/min auth, 2000 req/sec global
> - Production: 20 req/min auth, 5000 req/sec global

### Phase 4: Component Policies (Future)
17. [ ] Review existing minio/keycloak/kafka policies
18. [ ] Ensure they align with tier-based model
19. [ ] Document network flow requirements

---

## Validation Checklist

### Cross-Environment Isolation
- [ ] ameide-dev pods cannot reach ameide-staging
- [ ] ameide-dev pods cannot reach ameide-prod
- [ ] ameide-staging pods cannot reach ameide-prod
- [ ] ArgoCD can still sync all namespaces
- [ ] Prometheus can still scrape all namespaces

### Tier-Based Flow
- [ ] Frontend tier receives external traffic
- [ ] Backend tier receives traffic from frontend
- [ ] Data tier only receives traffic from backend/platform
- [ ] Data tier cannot be reached directly from external

### Gateway Policies
- [ ] Rate limiting blocks requests above threshold
- [ ] Rate limiting allows bursts with backoff
- [ ] Access logs sampled (not 100%) in production
- [ ] Health check endpoints respond correctly

### Data Layer Tolerations (2025-12-05)

Added tolerations/nodeSelector to data layer components for environment isolation:

| Component | Files | Commit |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **CNPG Postgres** | `sources/values/{dev,staging,production}/data/platform-postgres-clusters.yaml` | `1b622e9` |
| **ClickHouse** | `sources/values/{dev,staging,production}/data/data-clickhouse.yaml` | `b0e63b5` |

**Postgres structure** (uses CNPG `cluster.affinity` format):
```yaml
cluster:
  affinity:
    tolerations:
      - key: "ameide.io/environment"
        value: "dev"  # or staging/production
        effect: "NoSchedule"
    nodeSelector:
      ameide.io/pool: dev  # or staging/prod
```

**ClickHouse structure** (uses Altinity chart `clickhouse.tolerations` format):
```yaml
clickhouse:
  tolerations:
    - key: "ameide.io/environment"
      value: "dev"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    ameide.io/pool: dev
```

### Altinity ClickHouse Operator Issue (2025-12-05)

**Problem**: Altinity ClickHouse operator v0.25.5 is not reconciling CHI resources. Investigation shows:

- CHI specs have correct tolerations/nodeSelector in `spec.templates.podTemplates[*].spec`
- Operator logs show `podInformer`, `configMapInformer`, `serviceInformer` activity
- **No `chiInformer` events are logged** - the CHI informer isn't watching resources
- CHI status remains empty (never processed)
- StatefulSets are not created

**Root cause**: Suspected bug in Altinity operator v0.25.5 where the CHI informer factory isn't properly initialized.

**Workaround options**:
1. **Wait for fix**: Monitor Altinity releases for v0.25.6+ with informer fixes
2. **Manual StatefulSet patch** (temporary):
   ```bash
   # Create StatefulSet manually based on CHI spec (not recommended)
   kubectl patch sts <name> -n <ns> --type merge -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"tolerations":[...]}}}}'
   ```
3. **Downgrade operator**: Try earlier version (e.g., 0.24.x) if informer worked there

**Verification commands**:
```bash
# Check if operator is receiving CHI events
kubectl logs -n clickhouse-system deployment/clickhouse-operator -c altinity-clickhouse-operator | grep -i "chiInformer"

# Check CHI status (should show status, not empty)
kubectl get chi -n ameide-dev data-clickhouse -o jsonpath='{.status.status}'
```

### Secret Management (2025-12-05)

Per-environment unique passwords implemented using Helm lookup+randAlphaNum pattern:
- Template: `sources/charts/foundation/operators-config/postgres_clusters/templates/app-secrets.yaml`
- Commit: `d10ab77`

**How it works:**
1. First install: Helm generates random 32-char passwords for all Postgres users
2. Subsequent upgrades: Helm `lookup` function finds existing secrets and preserves passwords
3. Each namespace (dev/staging/prod) gets unique passwords automatically

This achieves environment isolation for database secrets without requiring Vault path migration. See [412-cnpg-owned-postgres-greds.md](412-cnpg-owned-postgres-greds.md) for the full CNPG credential ownership model.

### GitOps Implementation Complete ✅

All Helm chart and values file changes for environment isolation are complete. The remaining work is:
1. Deploy the 4-pool AKS configuration via Bicep (`az deployment`)
2. Verify pods receive correct labels after ArgoCD sync
3. Test environment shutdown procedure

## Problem Statement

Need clear isolation and differentiation between environments:

1. **No compute isolation**: All environments share single node pool
2. **No per-environment shutdown**: Cannot turn off dev/staging independently for cost savings
3. **Missing service labels**: Pods lack `ameide.io/tier` labels for NetworkPolicy
4. **Bicep template conflict**: Two AKS modules with different VM SKUs
5. **Resource allocation**: All environments use similar resource configs
6. **High availability**: Production runs single replicas like dev
7. **Scaling configuration**: HPA disabled everywhere
8. **No environment state management**: No GitOps flag to scale workloads to zero

## Tenancy Models (How This Applies)

All mechanisms described in this document (node pools, environmentState, HPA, PDBs) apply to three deployment models (see [443-tenancy-models.md](443-tenancy-models.md)):

| Tenancy Model | Cluster | Environment Isolation | Node Pool Usage |
|---------------|---------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Shared SaaS** | `ameide` cluster | `ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod` | Each env uses matching pool |
| **Namespace-per-tenant** | Shared `ameide` cluster | `tenant-<id>-prod` namespaces | Share **prod** pool with `ameide-prod` |
| **Private cloud** | Dedicated `ameide-<id>` cluster | Same 4-pool pattern per tenant | Tenant-owned pools |

**Key points:**

- For **Shared SaaS**, environment isolation is between `ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod` on separate node pools.
- For **Namespace-per-tenant**, each `tenant-<id>-prod` namespace behaves like a small production environment that shares the **prod node pool** with `ameide-prod`. Tenants are isolated via namespaces and NetworkPolicies, not dedicated pools.
- For **Private cloud**, the same 4-pool strategy is applied inside each tenant cluster.

> **Premium tenants**: Large namespace-per-tenant customers MAY receive dedicated node pools
> (e.g., `tenant-acme`) as an upsell option. This extends the 4-pool strategy rather than replacing it.

## Current State (Verified 2025-12-04)

### AKS Cluster Configuration

```bash
az aks show --name ameide --resource-group Ameide
az aks nodepool list --cluster-name ameide --resource-group Ameide
```

| Property | Documented | Actual | Gap |
|----------|-----------|--------|-----|
| **VM SKU** | D4as (prod) / D2as (dev) | `Standard_D8as_v6` | ⚠️ Over-provisioned |
| **Node Count** | 3-4 (prod) / 1 (dev) | 1 | Matches dev |
| **Autoscaling** | Yes (prod) | No | Missing for prod |
| **K8s Version** | 1.32.7 | 1.32.7 | ✅ |

### Bicep Template Conflict

Two AKS Bicep modules exist with **different configurations**:

| File | Non-Prod SKU | Prod SKU | Status |
|------|--------------|----------|--------|
| `azure/managed-application/modules/aks.bicep` | D2as_v6 | D4as_v6 | ✅ Aligned with 240 |
| `infra/bicep/managed-application/modules/aks.bicep` | D8as_v6 | D8as_v6 | ⚠️ **Deployed** (over-sized) |

> **Action Required**: Consolidate to single Bicep source. The `azure/` version follows 240 recommendations.

### Environment Matrix

| Aspect | Dev | Staging | Production |
|--------|-----|---------|------------|
| **Namespace** | ameide-dev | ameide-staging | ameide-prod |
| **Domain** | dev.ameide.io | staging.ameide.io | ameide.io |

### Namespace Conventions (with Tenants)

Internal environments on shared cluster:
- `ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod`

Namespace-per-tenant:
- `tenant-<slug>-prod` (and optionally `tenant-<slug>-staging`)

All namespaces are labeled:
- `ameide.io/environment`: `dev` | `staging` | `production`
- `ameide.io/tenant-kind`: `shared` | `namespace` | `private`
- `ameide.io/tenant-id`: `<slug>` (for tenant namespaces only)

> **Node affinity**: Namespace-per-tenant workloads in `tenant-*-prod` default to
> `nodeSelector: ameide.io/pool=prod` and tolerate the `ameide.io/environment=production`
> taint, just like `ameide-prod`.

### Resource Configuration by Environment

| Aspect | Dev | Staging | Production |
|--------|-----|---------|------------|
| **App Replicas** | 1 | 1 | 1 ⚠️ |
| **HPA Enabled** | No | No | No ⚠️ |
| **PDB Configured** | No | No | No ⚠️ |
| **CPU Requests** | 150m | 200m | 250m |
| **Memory Requests** | 256Mi | 256Mi | 512Mi |
| **Image Pull Policy** | Always | IfNotPresent | IfNotPresent |
| **Log Level** | debug | info | info |

### Pod Labels (Current)

```bash
kubectl get pods -A -o custom-columns='NS:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,TIER:.metadata.labels.ameide\.io/tier'
```

| Namespace | Has `ameide.io/tier` label? | Has `ameide.io/domain` label? |
|-----------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| ameide-dev | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| ameide-staging | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| ameide-prod | ❌ No | ❌ No |

> **Blocker**: Tier-based NetworkPolicies (441) require these labels on pods.

### Data Layer by Environment

## Proposed Changes

### 0. Consolidate Bicep Templates

**Priority**: HIGH (Technical Debt)

Remove duplicate Bicep module and align with 240 recommendations:

**Option A**: Use `azure/managed-application/` as canonical source
- Already has correct D4as/D2as sizing
- Delete `infra/bicep/managed-application/` or symlink

**Option B**: Update `infra/bicep/managed-application/` to match
- Change `vmSize: 'Standard_D8as_v6'` → conditional D4as/D2as

**Recommended Bicep configuration:**

```bicep
var systemAgentPoolBase = {
  name: 'system'
  vmSize: isProduction ? 'Standard_D4as_v6' : 'Standard_D2as_v6'
  // ... rest unchanged
}
```

---

### 1. Node Pool Strategy

**Priority**: HIGH

#### AKS Platform Constraints

From [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-system-pools):

- **System pool**: Must always have ≥1 node (best practice: ≥2)
- **User pools**: Can scale to **0 nodes** - this enables per-environment shutdown
- **Cluster stop**: Freezes ALL environments, not selective

#### Option A: Shared Non-Prod Pool (3 pools)

Simpler, but dev and staging shut down together:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  system      │ D2as_v6 × 2  │ Taints: CriticalAddonsOnly                │
│              │              │ Workloads: argocd, cert-manager, envoy    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  nonprod     │ D2as_v6 × 0-2│ Labels: ameide.io/pool=nonprod            │
│              │ (can be 0)   │ Workloads: ameide-dev + ameide-staging    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  prod        │ D4as_v6 × 3-4│ Labels: ameide.io/pool=prod               │
│              │ (autoscale)  │ Taints: ameide.io/environment=production  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Option B: Per-Environment Pools (4 pools) ← **Recommended for independent shutdown**

Each environment can be shut down independently:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  system      │ D4as_v6 × 2  │ Taints: CriticalAddonsOnly                │
│              │ (always on)  │ Workloads: argocd, cert-manager, envoy,   │
│              │              │   CNPG/redis/kafka operators              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  dev         │ D2as_v6 × 0-2│ Labels: ameide.io/pool=dev                │
│              │ (can be 0)   │ Workloads: ameide-dev only                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  staging     │ D2as_v6 × 0-2│ Labels: ameide.io/pool=staging            │
│              │ (can be 0)   │ Workloads: ameide-staging only            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  prod        │ D4as_v6 × 3-8│ Labels: ameide.io/pool=prod               │
│              │ (autoscale)  │ Taints: ameide.io/environment=production  │
│              │              │ Workloads: ameide-prod only               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight**: User pools can scale to 0 while system pool stays up. PVs (Azure Disks) remain attached to the scale set; when you scale up again, pods reattach.

#### Bicep Implementation (Option B)

**File**: `azure/managed-application/modules/aks.bicep`

```bicep
// System pool - always on, runs cluster infrastructure
var systemPool = {
  name: 'system'
  vmSize: 'Standard_D4as_v6'
  count: 2
  mode: 'System'
  osDiskSizeGB: 128
  maxPods: 110
  nodeTaints: ['CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoSchedule']
}

// Dev pool - can scale to 0
resource devPool 'Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools@2024-05-01' = {
  parent: cluster
  name: 'dev'
  properties: {
    vmSize: 'Standard_D2as_v6'
    count: 0  // Start at 0, scale up when needed
    enableAutoScaling: true
    minCount: 0
    maxCount: 2
    mode: 'User'
    nodeLabels: {
      'ameide.io/pool': 'dev'
      'ameide.io/environment': 'dev'
    }
  }
}

// Staging pool - can scale to 0
resource stagingPool 'Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools@2024-05-01' = {
  parent: cluster
  name: 'staging'
  properties: {
    vmSize: 'Standard_D2as_v6'
    count: 0
    enableAutoScaling: true
    minCount: 0
    maxCount: 2
    mode: 'User'
    nodeLabels: {
      'ameide.io/pool': 'staging'
      'ameide.io/environment': 'staging'
    }
  }
}

// Prod pool - always has minimum nodes
resource prodPool 'Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools@2024-05-01' = {
  parent: cluster
  name: 'prod'
  properties: {
    vmSize: 'Standard_D4as_v6'
    count: 3
    enableAutoScaling: true
    minCount: 3
    maxCount: 8
    mode: 'User'
    nodeLabels: {
      'ameide.io/pool': 'prod'
      'ameide.io/environment': 'production'
    }
    nodeTaints: ['ameide.io/environment=production:NoSchedule']
  }
}
```

#### Cost Comparison

| Config | Always-On Nodes | Monthly Est. | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| Current (D8as × 1) | 1 | ~$280 | Over-provisioned |
| Option A (3 pools) | system×2 + prod×3 = 5 | ~$490 | Dev+staging share |
| Option B (4 pools) | system×2 + prod×3 = 5 | ~$490 | Dev+staging at 0 nights/weekends |
| Option B (all on) | system×2 + dev×1 + staging×1 + prod×3 = 7 | ~$630 | All environments running |

> **Cost savings**: With Option B, turning off dev+staging nights/weekends saves ~$140/month (2 D2as nodes × ~14 hours/day × 20 days).

---

### 2. Service Tier Labels

**Priority**: HIGH (Required for 441 NetworkPolicies)

Add `ameide.io/tier` label to all pods via Helm charts.

**Label taxonomy:**

| Tier | Services | Source |
|------|----------|--------|
| `frontend` | www-ameide, www-ameide-platform | `apps/web/*` |
| `backend` | graph, inference, platform, agents, workflows, threads | `apps/core/*`, `apps/runtime/*` |
| `data` | postgres, redis, kafka, temporal, minio | `data/*` |
| `platform` | keycloak, grafana, prometheus, envoy-gateway | `platform/*` |
| `foundation` | cert-manager, external-secrets, vault | `foundation/*` |

**Implementation approach:**

**Option A**: Add to globals.yaml and reference in charts

```yaml
# sources/values/_shared/apps/apps-graph.yaml
tier: backend
domain: apps

# In Helm template
labels:
  ameide.io/tier: {{ .Values.tier | default "backend" }}
  ameide.io/domain: {{ .Values.domain | default "apps" }}
```

**Option B**: Derive from component.yaml `domain` field

The `component.yaml` already has `domain: apps|data|platform|foundation`. Map to tier:

| Domain | Tier |
|--------|------|
| `apps` (web/*) | frontend |
| `apps` (core/*, runtime/*) | backend |
| `data` | data |
| `platform` | platform |
| `foundation` | foundation |

**File**: `sources/charts/_helpers/common-labels.tpl`

```yaml
{{- define "common.labels" -}}
app.kubernetes.io/name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
app.kubernetes.io/instance: {{ .Release.Name }}
ameide.io/tier: {{ .Values.tier | default "backend" }}
ameide.io/environment: {{ .Values.environment }}
{{- end -}}
```

---

### 3. Node Affinity for Workloads

**Priority**: MEDIUM (After node pools exist)

Add nodeSelector and tolerations to production workloads:

**File**: `sources/values/production/globals.yaml`

```yaml
# Production workloads must run on prod pool
nodeSelector:
  ameide.io/pool: prod

tolerations:
  - key: "ameide.io/environment"
    value: "production"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

**File**: `sources/values/dev/globals.yaml`

```yaml
# Dev workloads run on dev pool
nodeSelector:
  ameide.io/pool: dev
```

**File**: `sources/values/staging/globals.yaml`

```yaml
# Staging workloads run on staging pool
nodeSelector:
  ameide.io/pool: staging
```

---

### 4. Per-Environment Shutdown Strategy

**Priority**: HIGH

Enable turning individual environments on/off for cost savings.

#### What "Environment OFF" Means

1. **Node pool scaled to 0** - No compute costs
2. **Workloads at 0 replicas** - No pending pods in scheduler
3. **PVs preserved** - Data persists, reattaches on scale-up

#### 4.1 GitOps State Flag

Add environment state to globals.yaml:

**File**: `sources/values/dev/globals.yaml`

```yaml
environment:
  name: dev
  state: "on"  # or "off"

namespace: ameide-dev
domain: dev.ameide.io
# ... rest of config
```

#### 4.2 Helm Helper for Replica Count

**File**: `sources/charts/_helpers/environment.tpl`

```yaml
{{/*
Returns replica count based on environment state.
If state is "off", returns 0 regardless of configured replicas.
*/}}
{{- define "ameide.replicaCount" -}}
{{- if eq ((.Values.environment).state | default "on") "off" -}}
0
{{- else -}}
{{- .Values.replicaCount | default 1 -}}
{{- end -}}
{{- end -}}

{{/*
Returns true if environment is active (state != "off")
*/}}
{{- define "ameide.isActive" -}}
{{- ne ((.Values.environment).state | default "on") "off" -}}
{{- end -}}
```

#### 4.3 Apply to Deployments

**File**: `sources/charts/apps/*/templates/deployment.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ include "app.fullname" . }}
spec:
  replicas: {{ include "ameide.replicaCount" . }}
  # ...
```

#### 4.4 Gate CronJobs on Environment State

**File**: `sources/charts/*/templates/cronjob.yaml`

```yaml
{{- if eq (include "ameide.isActive" .) "true" }}
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: {{ include "app.fullname" . }}-cleanup
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"
  # ...
{{- end }}
```

#### 4.5 Shutdown Procedure

**To turn OFF an environment (e.g., dev):**

```bash
# Step 1: Update GitOps state
# Edit sources/values/dev/globals.yaml
environment:
  state: "off"

# Step 2: Commit and push
git add sources/values/dev/globals.yaml
git commit -m "chore: turn off dev environment"
git push

# Step 3: Wait for ArgoCD sync (workloads → 0 replicas)
argocd app sync ameide-dev --prune

# Step 4: Scale node pool to 0
az aks nodepool scale \
  --resource-group Ameide \
  --cluster-name ameide \
  --name dev \
  --node-count 0
```

**To turn ON an environment:**

```bash
# Step 1: Scale node pool up
az aks nodepool scale \
  --resource-group Ameide \
  --cluster-name ameide \
  --name dev \
  --node-count 1

# Step 2: Update GitOps state
# Edit sources/values/dev/globals.yaml
environment:
  state: "on"

# Step 3: Commit and push
git add sources/values/dev/globals.yaml
git commit -m "chore: turn on dev environment"
git push

# Step 4: ArgoCD syncs, pods schedule on new nodes
```

#### 4.6 Automation (Optional)

Use Azure Automation or GitHub Actions for scheduled shutdown:

**GitHub Actions example** (`.github/workflows/env-scheduler.yml`):

```yaml
name: Environment Scheduler

on:
  schedule:
    # Turn off dev+staging at 8 PM UTC weekdays
    - cron: '0 20 * * 1-5'
    # Turn on dev+staging at 6 AM UTC weekdays
    - cron: '0 6 * * 1-5'
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Environment (dev/staging)'
        required: true
      action:
        description: 'Action (on/off)'
        required: true

jobs:
  toggle-environment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Determine action from schedule
        id: schedule
        run: |
          HOUR=$(date -u +%H)
          if [ "$HOUR" -eq "20" ]; then
            echo "action=off" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "action=on" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi

      - name: Update globals.yaml
        run: |
          ACTION=${{ github.event.inputs.action || steps.schedule.outputs.action }}
          for ENV in dev staging; do
            yq -i '.environment.state = "'$ACTION'"' sources/values/$ENV/globals.yaml
          done

      - name: Commit changes
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add sources/values/*/globals.yaml
          git commit -m "chore: scheduled environment $ACTION" || true
          git push

      - name: Scale node pools
        env:
          AZURE_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
        run: |
          az login --service-principal ...
          ACTION=${{ github.event.inputs.action || steps.schedule.outputs.action }}
          COUNT=$([[ "$ACTION" == "on" ]] && echo 1 || echo 0)
          for POOL in dev staging; do
            az aks nodepool scale \
              --resource-group Ameide \
              --cluster-name ameide \
              --name $POOL \
              --node-count $COUNT
          done
```

#### 4.7 Data Persistence During Shutdown

> **Important**: PVs (Azure Disks) are NOT deleted when node pool scales to 0.

| Resource | Behavior During Shutdown |
|----------|-------------------------|
| PVCs (Azure Disk) | ✅ Preserved, reattaches on scale-up |
| ConfigMaps/Secrets | ✅ Preserved in etcd |
| CronJob history | ✅ Preserved |
| Logs (Loki) | ✅ Preserved in MinIO/Azure Blob |
| Metrics (Prometheus) | ⚠️ Gap during downtime |

#### 4.8 Tenants and environmentState

> **How environmentState applies to tenants:**
>
> - For **Shared SaaS** and **namespace-per-tenant** on the shared cluster, `environmentState`
>   controls the internal environments (`dev`, `staging`, `ameide-prod`) and is **not**
>   used to selectively shut down a single tenant namespace.
> - For **Private cloud**, `environmentState` is applied per tenant cluster
>   (e.g., only their `ameide-dev` namespace is scaled to zero).
>
> Per-tenant shutdown (namespace-per-tenant) is **future work** and would be modelled
> as a per-tenant flag in `sources/values/tenants/<tenant-id>/globals.yaml`:
>
> ```yaml
> # sources/values/tenants/acme/globals.yaml
> tenant:
>   id: acme
>   state: "off"  # Future: scale tenant workloads to 0
> ```

---

### 5. Resource Tier Definitions

**Priority**: MEDIUM

Define clear resource tiers per environment:

**File**: `sources/values/dev/globals.yaml`

```yaml
namespace: ameide-dev
environment: dev
domain: dev.ameide.io

# Minimal resources for development
resources:
  defaults:
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 128Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 512Mi

# Single replica, no autoscaling
replicas:
  default: 1

autoscaling:
  enabled: false

logLevel: debug
imagePullPolicy: Always
```

**File**: `sources/values/staging/globals.yaml`

```yaml
namespace: ameide-staging
environment: staging
domain: staging.ameide.io

# Production-like resources, lower scale
resources:
  defaults:
    requests:
      cpu: 200m
      memory: 256Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 1Gi

# Match production replica count
replicas:
  default: 2

autoscaling:
  enabled: true
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 5

logLevel: info
imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

**File**: `sources/values/production/globals.yaml`

```yaml
namespace: ameide-prod
environment: production
domain: ameide.io

# Full production resources
resources:
  defaults:
    requests:
      cpu: 250m
      memory: 512Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 2000m
      memory: 2Gi

# High availability
replicas:
  default: 3

autoscaling:
  enabled: true
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPU: 70
  targetMemory: 80

logLevel: info
imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

### 2. Enable HPA for Production Services

**Priority**: HIGH

Update app values to use HPA in production:

**File**: `sources/values/_shared/apps/platform.yaml`

```yaml
# HPA configuration (enabled per-environment)
autoscaling:
  enabled: false  # Overridden in production
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 70
  targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 80
```

**File**: `sources/values/production/apps/platform/platform.yaml`

```yaml
autoscaling:
  enabled: true
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
```

### 3. Add PodDisruptionBudgets

**Priority**: MEDIUM

Add PDB template to application charts:

**File**: `sources/charts/apps/platform/templates/pdb.yaml`

```yaml
{{- if .Values.podDisruptionBudget.enabled }}
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: {{ include "platform.fullname" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "platform.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
spec:
  {{- if .Values.podDisruptionBudget.minAvailable }}
  minAvailable: {{ .Values.podDisruptionBudget.minAvailable }}
  {{- else }}
  maxUnavailable: {{ .Values.podDisruptionBudget.maxUnavailable | default 1 }}
  {{- end }}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      {{- include "platform.selectorLabels" . | nindent 6 }}
{{- end }}
```

**Values**:

```yaml
# sources/values/_shared/apps/platform.yaml
podDisruptionBudget:
  enabled: false

# sources/values/production/apps/platform/platform.yaml
podDisruptionBudget:
  enabled: true
  minAvailable: 2
```

### 4. Namespace Network Policies

**Priority**: MEDIUM

Create per-namespace isolation:

**File**: `sources/charts/foundation/common/raw-manifests/templates/networkpolicy-namespace.yaml`

```yaml
{{- if .Values.networkPolicy.enabled }}
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: namespace-isolation
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    # Allow from same namespace
    - from:
        - podSelector: {}
    # Allow from argocd for sync
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: argocd
    # Allow from observability
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: {{ .Values.namespace }}
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app.kubernetes.io/name: prometheus
  egress:
    # Allow DNS
    - to:
        - namespaceSelector: {}
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              k8s-app: kube-dns
      ports:
        - protocol: UDP
          port: 53
    # Allow same namespace
    - to:
        - podSelector: {}
    # Allow external (internet)
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
            except:
              - 10.0.0.0/8
              - 172.16.0.0/12
              - 192.168.0.0/16
{{- end }}
```

### 5. Environment-Specific Vault Paths

**Priority**: LOW

Organize secrets by environment:

**Current**: All environments share `/ameide/*` paths

**Proposed**: Environment-prefixed paths

```yaml
# Vault secret structure
ameide/
├── dev/
│   ├── postgres-ameide-password
│   ├── keycloak-admin-password
│   └── ...
├── staging/
│   ├── postgres-ameide-password
│   └── ...
└── production/
    ├── postgres-ameide-password
    └── ...
```

**Update ExternalSecret paths**:

```yaml
# sources/values/_shared/foundation/foundation-vault-secrets-platform.yaml
vaultSecretPath: "ameide/{{ .Values.environment }}"
```

---

## Observability Stack Scaling

### Current State

| Component | Replicas | Mode |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Prometheus | 1 | Single |
| Loki | 1 | Single Binary |
| Tempo | 1 | Single Binary |
| OTEL Collector | 1 (prod: 2) | Deployment |

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 0: Bicep Consolidation
1. [x] Decide canonical Bicep source (`azure/` vs `bicep/`) → **`bicep/` is canonical**
2. [x] Update VM SKU to D4as/D2as per 240 recommendations → **Done in aks.bicep**
3. [ ] Test Bicep deployment in dev subscription
4. [ ] Remove or deprecate duplicate Bicep module (`azure/` directory)

### Phase 1: Service Tier Labels
5. [x] Add `tier` field to all values files (`_shared/apps/*.yaml`, etc.) → **2025-12-04**
6. [x] Create common-labels helper template → **per-chart `<name>.tierLabels` helpers**
7. [x] Update Helm charts to include `ameide.io/tier` label → **14 app charts updated 2025-12-04**
8. [ ] Deploy and verify labels with `kubectl get pods --show-labels`

### Phase 2: Node Pool Strategy (Option B - Per-Environment)
9. [x] Add `system`, `dev`, `staging`, `prod` node pool definitions to Bicep → **2025-12-04**
10. [x] Configure dev/staging pools with `minCount: 0` for shutdown capability → **Done**
11. [x] Deploy node pools to AKS cluster → **Deployed via Terraform 2025-12-05**
12. [x] Add nodeSelector to globals.yaml per environment → **2025-12-04**
13. [x] Add prod tolerations for production taint → **2025-12-04**
14. [x] Verify workloads schedule on correct pools → **Verified 2025-12-05** (dev→aks-dev-*, staging→aks-staging-*, prod→aks-prod-*)

### Phase 3: Environment Shutdown Capability
15. [x] Add `environmentState` field to all globals.yaml files → **2025-12-04**
16. [x] Create `ameide.replicaCount` Helm helper template → **ameide-library chart**
17. [x] Create `ameide.isActive` Helm helper template → **ameide-library chart**
18. [ ] Update Deployment templates to use `ameide.replicaCount`
19. [ ] Update CronJob templates to gate on `ameide.isActive`
20. [ ] Test shutdown procedure manually (dev first)
21. [ ] Document shutdown/startup runbook

### Phase 4: Shutdown Automation (Optional)
22. [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for scheduled shutdown
23. [ ] Configure Azure service principal for nodepool scaling
24. [ ] Test scheduled shutdown (nights/weekends)
25. [ ] Monitor cost savings

### Phase 5: Resource Tiers
26. [x] Update dev globals.yaml with minimal resources → **Done (150m/256Mi)**
27. [x] Update staging globals.yaml with medium resources → **Done (200m/256Mi)**
28. [x] Update production globals.yaml with full resources → **Done (250m/512Mi)**

## Validation Checklist

### Bicep & Node Pools
- [x] Single canonical Bicep source exists → `infra/bicep/managed-application/modules/aks.bicep`
- [x] Node pools created: system, dev, staging, prod → **Deployed 2025-12-05** (system:2, dev:3, staging:2, prod:3)
- [x] Dev/staging pools have `minCount: 0` configured in Bicep
- [x] Prod pool has autoscaling enabled (3-8 nodes) configured in Bicep
- [x] All pools have correct `ameide.io/pool` labels configured in Bicep

### Service Tier Labels
- [x] `tier` field added to all app values files (20+ files)
- [x] `<chartname>.tierLabels` helper created in each app chart `_helpers.tpl`
- [x] Helm charts updated to include tierLabels in deployment templates (14 charts)
- [ ] All pods have `ameide.io/tier` label (needs ArgoCD sync after node pool deploy)
- [ ] All pods have `ameide.io/environment` label (needs ArgoCD sync after node pool deploy)

### Node Affinity
- [x] nodeSelector configured in globals.yaml per environment
- [x] Tolerations configured in globals.yaml per environment
- [x] Third-party chart subcomponents have tolerations (console, provisioning jobs) → Fixed `9e54a78`
- [x] Production workloads run on prod pool only → **Verified 2025-12-05** (pods→aks-prod-*)
- [x] Dev workloads run on dev pool only → **Verified 2025-12-05** (pods→aks-dev-*)
- [x] Staging workloads run on staging pool only → **Verified 2025-12-05** (pods→aks-staging-*)
- [x] System workloads run on system pool → **Verified 2025-12-05** (argocd, cert-manager on system nodes)

### Environment Shutdown
- [x] `environmentState` field exists in all globals.yaml
- [x] `ameide.replicaCount` helper created in ameide-library chart
- [x] `ameide.isActive` helper created in ameide-library chart
- [ ] Deployment templates updated to use `ameide.replicaCount`
- [ ] CronJob templates gate on `ameide.isActive`
- [ ] Setting `environmentState: "off"` scales workloads to 0 (needs testing)
- [ ] Dev pool can scale to 0 nodes (needs testing)
- [ ] PVs persist when pool is at 0 nodes (needs testing)
- [ ] Shutdown/startup runbook documented

### Shutdown Automation (if implemented)
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow triggers on schedule
- [ ] Azure credentials configured securely
- [ ] Scheduled shutdown works (nights/weekends)
- [ ] Cost savings visible in Azure Cost Management

### Resource Tiers
- [x] Dev apps use minimal resources → `defaultResources` in `globals.yaml` (150m/256Mi)
- [x] Staging apps use medium resources → `defaultResources` in `globals.yaml` (200m/256Mi)
- [x] Production apps use full resources → `defaultResources` in `globals.yaml` (250m/512Mi)
- [ ] Resource limits enforced (apps must reference global defaults)

### High Availability
- [ ] Production services have min 2 replicas
- [ ] HPA scales under load
- [ ] PDB prevents all pods going down
- [ ] Node drain respects PDB

### Secret Management
- [x] Each environment has isolated secrets → **Helm lookup+randAlphaNum pattern generates unique passwords per namespace**
- [x] No cross-environment secret access → **Secrets generated in-namespace, not shared**
- [ ] Secret rotation works per-environment → **Planned: Delete secret + ArgoCD sync regenerates**

## Overview

AMEIDE supports three tenancy models (SKUs) that can be deployed independently or in combination. This document serves as the **single source of truth** for tenancy concepts referenced across all architecture documents.

## Two Orthogonal Axes

All deployments are characterized by two independent axes:

```
                    Tenant Axis
                        │
    ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
    │                   │                   │
    │   Shared SaaS     │  Namespace-per-   │
    │   (multi-tenant   │  tenant           │
    │    app-level)     │  (namespace       │
    │                   │   isolation)      │
    │                   │                   │
────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼──── Environment Axis
    │                   │                   │     (dev/staging/prod)
    │   Private Cloud   │                   │
    │   (dedicated      │                   │
    │    cluster)       │                   │
    │                   │                   │
    └───────────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

- **Environment axis**: `dev`, `staging`, `production` – Controls SDLC stage
- **Tenant axis**: `shared`, `namespace`, `private` – Controls isolation level

## SKU Matrix

| SKU | Cluster Pattern | Namespace Pattern | Isolation Level | Target Customer |
|-----|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Shared SaaS** | Single `ameide` cluster | `ameide-prod` | Application-level (row-level) | SMB, self-serve |
| **Namespace-per-tenant** | Single `ameide` cluster per region | `tenant-<slug>-prod` | Kubernetes namespace | Mid-market |
| **Private Cloud** | Dedicated `ameide-<slug>` cluster | `ameide-dev/staging/prod` | Full cluster | Enterprise, regulated |

## Label Reference

All workloads MUST be labeled consistently to support isolation policies.

### Required Labels

| Label | Values | Scope | Description |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------|
| `ameide.io/environment` | `dev`, `staging`, `production`, `cluster` | Namespace, Pod | SDLC stage |
| `ameide.io/tenant-kind` | `shared`, `namespace`, `private` | Namespace, Pod | Tenancy model |
| `ameide.io/tenant-id` | `<tenant-slug>` | Namespace, Pod | Tenant identifier (omit for shared) |
| `ameide.io/tier` | `frontend`, `backend`, `data`, `platform`, `foundation` | Pod | Service tier for NetworkPolicy |

### Label Examples

**Shared SaaS namespace (`ameide-prod`):**
```yaml
metadata:
  name: ameide-prod
  labels:
    ameide.io/environment: production
    ameide.io/tenant-kind: shared
    # No tenant-id for shared
```

**Namespace-per-tenant (`tenant-acme-prod`):**
```yaml
metadata:
  name: tenant-acme-prod
  labels:
    ameide.io/environment: production
    ameide.io/tenant-kind: namespace
    ameide.io/tenant-id: acme
```

**Private cloud namespace (`ameide-prod` in dedicated cluster):**
```yaml
metadata:
  name: ameide-prod
  labels:
    ameide.io/environment: production
    ameide.io/tenant-kind: private
    ameide.io/tenant-id: acme
```

**Pod labels (backend service):**
```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    ameide.io/environment: production
    ameide.io/tenant-kind: namespace
    ameide.io/tenant-id: acme
    ameide.io/tier: backend
```

---

## Namespace Naming Conventions

| Tenancy Model | Namespace Pattern | Examples |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| Shared SaaS | `ameide-<env>` | `ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod` |
| Namespace-per-tenant | `tenant-<slug>-<env>` | `tenant-acme-prod`, `tenant-contoso-staging` |
| Private cloud | `ameide-<env>` (in tenant cluster) | `ameide-prod` in cluster `ameide-acme` |

### Internal vs Tenant Namespaces

```
Shared cluster (ameide):
├── ameide-dev          # Internal development
├── ameide-staging      # Internal staging
├── ameide-prod         # Shared SaaS production
├── tenant-acme-prod    # Namespace tenant: Acme
├── tenant-contoso-prod # Namespace tenant: Contoso
├── argocd              # Cluster-scoped (environment: cluster)
└── cert-manager        # Cluster-scoped (environment: cluster)
```

---

## Domain Routing Patterns

| Tenancy Model | Domain Pattern | HTTPRoute Target |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| Shared SaaS | `*.ameide.io` | `ameide-prod` namespace |
| Namespace-per-tenant | `*.<tenant>.ameide.io` | `tenant-<tenant>-prod` namespace |
| Namespace-per-tenant | Custom domain (CNAME) | `tenant-<tenant>-prod` namespace |
| Private cloud | `*.ameide-<tenant>.io` | `ameide-prod` in tenant cluster |
| Private cloud | Custom domain | `ameide-prod` in tenant cluster |

---

## Infrastructure by SKU

### Bicep Deployment Modes

| SKU | Bicep Usage | Subscription |
|-----|-------------|--------------|
| Shared SaaS | `deploy-managed-app.sh staging/production` | AMEIDE subscription |
| Namespace-per-tenant | No new Bicep; GitOps only | AMEIDE subscription |
| Private cloud | `deploy-managed-app.sh` with tenant params | Customer subscription |

See [439-deploy-infrastructure.md](439-deploy-infrastructure.md) for details.

### Compute Resources

| SKU | Node Pools | Node Affinity |
|-----|------------|---------------|
| Shared SaaS | system, dev, staging, prod | Workloads use environment pool |
| Namespace-per-tenant | Same shared pools | `tenant-*-prod` → `prod` pool |
| Private cloud | Dedicated 4-pool strategy | Same pattern in tenant cluster |

See [442-environment-isolation.md](442-environment-isolation.md) for node pool strategy.

### Storage Resources

| SKU | Database | Object Storage | Backup |
|-----|----------|----------------|--------|
| Shared SaaS | Shared CNPG, multi-tenant schema | Shared MinIO, tenant prefix | Shared backup location |
| Namespace-per-tenant | Shared CNPG cluster, separate DB | Shared MinIO, `/<tenant>/` prefix | Per-tenant backup path |
| Private cloud | Dedicated CNPG cluster | Dedicated Storage Account | Customer-controlled |

See [440-storage-concerns.md](440-storage-concerns.md) for storage architecture.

### Network Isolation

| SKU | Isolation Mechanism | NetworkPolicy |
|-----|---------------------|---------------|
| Shared SaaS | Application-level (tenant_id) | Cross-env deny only |
| Namespace-per-tenant | Kubernetes namespace | Cross-env + cross-tenant deny |
| Private cloud | Cluster boundary | Standard cross-env deny |

See [441-networking.md](441-networking.md) for NetworkPolicy templates.

---

## GitOps Configuration

### ApplicationSet Strategy

**Shared SaaS** uses the standard environment list:
```yaml
generators:
  - list:
      elements:
        - env: production
          tenantKind: shared
          namespace: ameide-prod
```

**Namespace-per-tenant** extends the list:
```yaml
generators:
  - list:
      elements:
        # Shared SaaS
        - env: production
          tenantKind: shared
          namespace: ameide-prod
        # Namespace tenants
        - env: production
          tenantKind: namespace
          tenantId: acme
          namespace: tenant-acme-prod
        - env: production
          tenantKind: namespace
          tenantId: contoso
          namespace: tenant-contoso-prod
```

**Private cloud** uses separate GitOps repos or branches per tenant.

### Values Structure

```
sources/values/
├── _shared/                    # Shared across all environments
├── dev/                        # Internal dev
├── staging/                    # Internal staging
├── production/                 # Shared SaaS production
└── tenants/                    # Namespace-per-tenant overrides
    ├── acme/
    │   ├── globals.yaml        # Tenant-specific globals
    │   └── apps/               # Tenant-specific app values
    └── contoso/
        └── globals.yaml
```

> **Scaling note**: For >20 tenants, consider replacing the `list` generator with a
> `git` generator that reads tenant definitions from `sources/values/tenants/*/tenant.yaml` files.

See [434-unified-environment-naming.md](434-unified-environment-naming.md) for GitOps structure.

## Decision Tree: Which SKU?

```
Start
  │
  ├─ Does customer require dedicated infrastructure?
  │   │
  │   ├─ Yes → Does customer require their own Azure subscription?
  │   │         │
  │   │         ├─ Yes → Private Cloud (Managed App)
  │   │         │
  │   │         └─ No → Private Cloud (in AMEIDE subscription)
  │   │
  │   └─ No → Does customer require namespace isolation?
  │            │
  │            ├─ Yes → Namespace-per-tenant
  │            │
  │            └─ No → Shared SaaS
```

### SKU Selection Criteria

| Requirement | Shared SaaS | Namespace-per-tenant | Private Cloud |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Data residency in customer subscription | - | - | **Required** |
| SOC 2 Type II dedicated audit | - | Possible | **Required** |

### Recent Implementation (2025-12-04)

**Namespace Parameterization Complete:**
- Removed all hardcoded `namespace: ameide` from shared values files
- ExternalSecret manifests now use `{{ .Release.Namespace }}`
- CNPG postgres cluster uses dynamic namespace (removed `namespaceOverride`)
- All services use short DNS names (Kubernetes resolves within namespace)

**Tier Labels Implemented:**
- All app values files (`sources/values/_shared/apps/*.yaml`) include:
  - `tier: backend|frontend|data|platform`
  - `domain: apps|data|platform|foundation`
  - `exposure: internal|public`
- Chart `_helpers.tpl` files include `tierLabels` helper that outputs:
  - `ameide.io/tier: {{ .Values.tier }}`
  - `ameide.io/environment: {{ .Values.environment }}`

**Files Modified:**
- 12 app chart `_helpers.tpl` and `deployment.yaml` files
- 29 shared values files under `sources/values/_shared/`
- CNPG, Kafka, Clickhouse operator config templates

See commits: `ca030c2`, `05f8f00`, `075d05e`

## Overview

Terraform-first infrastructure provisioning for multi-cloud deployment. Bicep retained only for Azure Marketplace SaaS offer compliance.

## Why Terraform + Bicep

| Requirement | Terraform | Bicep |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Azure Marketplace SaaS | Not supported | Required |
| Multi-cloud (AWS, GCP) | Native | Azure only |
| Local development | Flexible | N/A |
| State management | Backend needed | None |
| Developer experience | Consistent | Azure-specific |

**Decision**: Terraform as primary IaC, Bicep only for Marketplace.

## Command Interface

```bash
./infra/scripts/deploy.sh [target] -e [environment]

Targets:
  azure         Terraform Azure (default)
  azure-bicep   Bicep for Azure Marketplace only
  aws           Terraform AWS (future)
  local         k3d + Terraform (future)
  bootstrap     ArgoCD bootstrap only (any existing cluster)
```

```

### State Management

The Terraform backend storage is **auto-created** by `deploy.sh` if it doesn't exist:

```bash
# Backend storage configuration (can be overridden via environment variables)
TF_STATE_RG="ameide-tfstate"           # Resource group
TF_STATE_SA="ameidetfstate"            # Storage account
TF_STATE_CONTAINER="tfstate"           # Blob container
TF_STATE_LOCATION="westeurope"         # Location

# deploy.sh automatically:
# 1. Creates resource group if missing
# 2. Creates storage account with TLS 1.2, no public blob access
# 3. Creates container with Azure AD auth
# 4. Assigns Storage Blob Data Contributor role to current user
```

```hcl
# Azure backend (infra/terraform/azure/versions.tf)
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "ameide-tfstate"
    storage_account_name = "ameidetfstate"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "azure.tfstate"
    use_azuread_auth     = true  # No storage keys needed
  }
}
```

## Deployment Flow

```
deploy.sh azure
    ├── terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/azure apply
    │   └── Creates: AKS, KeyVault, DNS, managed identities
    └── bootstrap/bootstrap.sh
        └── Installs: ArgoCD + ApplicationSet

deploy.sh azure-bicep
    ├── az deployment group create (Bicep)
    │   └── Creates: Same resources via ARM
    └── bootstrap/bootstrap.sh (or Bicep deployment script)
```

## Terraform Modules

### azure-aks

Provisions AKS cluster with environment-specific node pools.

```hcl
module "aks" {
  source = "../modules/azure-aks"

  name                = "ameide"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  location            = var.location

  node_pools = {
    system = {
      vm_size    = "Standard_D4as_v6"
      node_count = 2
      taints     = ["CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoSchedule"]
    }
    dev = {
      vm_size   = "Standard_D2as_v6"
      min_count = 0
      max_count = 2
      labels    = { "ameide.io/pool" = "dev" }
      taints    = ["ameide.io/environment=dev:NoSchedule"]
    }
    staging = {
      vm_size   = "Standard_D2as_v6"
      min_count = 0
      max_count = 2
      labels    = { "ameide.io/pool" = "staging" }
      taints    = ["ameide.io/environment=staging:NoSchedule"]
    }
    prod = {
      vm_size   = "Standard_D4as_v6"
      min_count = 3
      max_count = 8
      labels    = { "ameide.io/pool" = "prod" }
      taints    = ["ameide.io/environment=production:NoSchedule"]
    }
  }

  enable_workload_identity = true
  enable_oidc_issuer       = true
}
```

### azure-identity

Managed identities with workload identity federation for Kubernetes.

```hcl
module "dns_identity" {
  source = "../modules/azure-identity"

  name                = "ameide-dns-mi"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name

  federated_credentials = {
    cert-manager = {
      issuer    = module.aks.oidc_issuer_url
      namespace = "cert-manager"
      service_account = "cert-manager"
    }
  }

  role_assignments = {
    dns_contributor = {
      scope = azurerm_dns_zone.main.id
      role  = "DNS Zone Contributor"
    }
  }
}
```

## Deploy Script

Location: `infra/scripts/deploy.sh`

```bash
./infra/scripts/deploy.sh azure -e dev        # Terraform + bootstrap
./infra/scripts/deploy.sh azure-bicep -e dev  # Bicep + bootstrap
./infra/scripts/deploy.sh bootstrap           # Bootstrap only
```

The script orchestrates:
1. Terraform/Bicep infrastructure provisioning
2. AKS credential retrieval
3. ArgoCD bootstrap via `bootstrap/bootstrap.sh --install-argo --apply-root-apps`

## Migration from Bicep

### Phase 1: Terraform Azure Module

1. Create `infra/terraform/modules/azure-aks/`
2. Create `infra/terraform/modules/azure-keyvault/`
3. Create `infra/terraform/modules/azure-dns/`
4. Create `infra/terraform/modules/azure-identity/`
5. Create `infra/terraform/azure/` workspace

### Phase 2: Validate Parity

1. Deploy Terraform to new resource group
2. Compare outputs with Bicep deployment
3. Verify ArgoCD bootstrap works identically

### Phase 3: Switch Default

1. Update `scripts/deploy.sh` to default to Terraform
2. Move Bicep to `azure-bicep` target
3. Update README and documentation

### Phase 4: Future Targets

- [ ] AWS EKS module
- [ ] Local k3d configuration
- [ ] GCP GKE module (if needed)

## Terraform vs Bicep Feature Mapping

| Bicep Resource | Terraform Resource |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters` | `azurerm_kubernetes_cluster` |
| `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults` | `azurerm_key_vault` |
| `Microsoft.Network/dnsZones` | `azurerm_dns_zone` |
| `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities` | `azurerm_user_assigned_identity` |
| `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/.../federatedIdentityCredentials` | `azurerm_federated_identity_credential` |
| `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces` | `azurerm_log_analytics_workspace` |
| `Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts` | `null_resource` + `local-exec` |

## Outputs

Both Terraform and Bicep produce identical outputs for bootstrap:

```hcl
output "aks_cluster_name" { value = module.aks.name }
output "aks_oidc_issuer" { value = module.aks.oidc_issuer_url }
output "keyvault_uri" { value = module.keyvault.vault_uri }
output "dns_identity_client_id" { value = module.dns_identity.client_id }
output "envoy_public_ip" { value = azurerm_public_ip.envoy.ip_address }
```

Outputs written to `artifacts/terraform-outputs/azure.json` for bootstrap consumption.

## Secrets Seeding from .env

The `deploy.sh` script automatically seeds secrets from `.env` and `.env.local` to Azure Key Vault during Terraform deployment. See [451-secrets-management.md](451-secrets-management.md) for the complete flow.

### How It Works

1. **Parse .env files** → `deploy.sh` reads `.env` and `.env.local`
2. **Sanitize keys** → `GHCR_TOKEN` becomes `ghcr-token` (lowercase, underscores to dashes)
3. **Create tfvars.json** → Temporary file with `env_secrets` variable
4. **Terraform apply** → `azurerm_key_vault_secret` resources created
5. **vault-bootstrap** → CronJob fetches from Key Vault, writes to HashiCorp Vault
6. **ExternalSecrets** → Syncs from Vault to Kubernetes Secrets

```bash
# Example .env file
GHCR_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
GHCR_USER=myuser
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=xxx

# Results in Azure Key Vault secrets:
# - ghcr-token
# - ghcr-user
# - langfuse-secret-key
```

### Terraform Configuration

```hcl
# infra/terraform/azure/main.tf
resource "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "env_secrets" {
  for_each = nonsensitive(toset(keys(var.env_secrets)))

  name         = each.key   # Already sanitized by deploy.sh
  value        = var.env_secrets[each.key]
  key_vault_id = module.keyvault.id
}
```

### Helm Values for vault-bootstrap

```yaml
# sources/values/dev/foundation/foundation-vault-bootstrap.yaml
azure:
  workloadIdentity:
    enabled: true
    clientId: "<vault-bootstrap-mi-client-id>"
    tenantId: "<tenant-id>"
  keyVault:
    uri: "https://ameidekv.vault.azure.net/"
    secretPrefix: ""   # No prefix - matches sanitized .env keys
```

## 445-argocd-namespace-isolation.md

# 445: ArgoCD Namespace Isolation

## Status: Implemented

## Summary

ArgoCD runs in its own isolated `argocd` namespace with dedicated infrastructure resources, completely independent of application environment namespaces (dev/staging/production). This ensures ArgoCD remains operational even when all environment namespaces are scaled down or unavailable.

## Problem

Previously, ArgoCD TLS certificates depended on cert-manager deployed in environment namespaces (e.g., `ameide-dev`). This created several issues:

1. **Circular dependency**: ArgoCD manages environment deployments, but depended on those environments for its own TLS
2. **Availability risk**: If dev namespace was scaled down or unhealthy, ArgoCD lost TLS capability
3. **Blast radius**: Environment issues could impact cluster-wide GitOps operations

## Architecture

### Namespace Isolation Model

### Cert-Manager Instances

There are **multiple cert-manager instances** in the cluster, each with a specific purpose:

| Instance | Namespace | Purpose | DNS Zone | Managed By |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|------------|
| `argocd-cert-manager` | `argocd` | ArgoCD TLS only | `ameide.io` (apex) | ArgoCD self-manages |
| `foundation-cert-manager` | `ameide-dev` | Dev environment certs | `dev.ameide.io` | ArgoCD ApplicationSet |
| `foundation-cert-manager` | `ameide-staging` | Staging environment certs | `staging.ameide.io` | ArgoCD ApplicationSet |
| `foundation-cert-manager` | `ameide-prod` | Production environment certs | `ameide.io` | ArgoCD ApplicationSet |

### Why Multiple Cert-Managers?

1. **Isolation**: Environment failures don't affect ArgoCD
2. **Namespace-scoped resources**: Each cert-manager manages Issuers and Certificates in its namespace
3. **Independent scaling**: Environments can scale to zero without affecting cluster operations
4. **Cleaner RBAC**: Each cert-manager only needs permissions for its namespace's DNS zone

## Sync Waves

ArgoCD uses sync waves to ensure correct deployment order:

| Wave | Application | Resources |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| -1 | `argocd-cert-manager` | cert-manager Deployment, CRDs, Webhook |
| 0 | `argocd-tls` | ClusterIssuer, Certificate |
| 1 | `cluster-gateway` | GatewayClass, EnvoyProxy, Gateway, HTTPRoute |
| (default) | Projects, ApplicationSets | AppProjects, ApplicationSets |

## DNS Configuration

| Domain | Type | Target | IP Address | Purpose |
|--------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| `argocd.ameide.io` | A | Cluster Gateway | 20.160.216.7 | ArgoCD UI/API |
| `*.dev.ameide.io` | A | Dev Gateway | 40.68.113.216 | Dev environment apps |
| `*.staging.ameide.io` | A | Staging Gateway | 108.142.228.7 | Staging environment apps |
| `*.ameide.io` | A | Prod Gateway | 4.180.130.190 | Production apps |

## Workload Identity

The ArgoCD cert-manager uses Azure Workload Identity to authenticate with Azure DNS:

```yaml
serviceAccount:
  annotations:
    azure.workload.identity/client-id: "<dns-managed-identity-client-id>"

podLabels:
  azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
```

This allows cert-manager to create DNS-01 challenge records in the `ameide.io` zone for Let's Encrypt validation.

## Operational Considerations

### Scaling Environments to Zero

When environments are scaled down (e.g., dev at night):
- Environment cert-manager pods stop
- Environment certificates remain valid (secrets persist)
- **ArgoCD continues operating normally** with its own cert-manager

### Disaster Recovery

If ArgoCD namespace is deleted:
1. Re-run `bootstrap/bootstrap.sh --install-argo --apply-root-apps`
2. ArgoCD self-heals by syncing `argocd-config` Application
3. Cert-manager and TLS are restored automatically

### Monitoring

Key metrics to monitor:
- `argocd` namespace pod health
- Certificate expiration (`cert-manager_certificate_expiration_timestamp_seconds`)
- ArgoCD application sync status

## System Node Pool Tolerations

The ArgoCD cert-manager requires tolerations to run on system node pools that have `CriticalAddonsOnly` taints:

```yaml
# argocd/cert-manager.yaml
tolerations:
  - key: CriticalAddonsOnly
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
```

This is applied to:
- `cert-manager` controller
- `cert-manager-webhook`
- `cert-manager-cainjector`

## Namespace Categories

### 1. Operator Namespaces (Cluster-Scoped, Always Running)

These namespaces contain operators that watch ALL namespaces:

| Namespace | Operator | Watches | Can Scale to Zero? |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `argocd` | ArgoCD + cert-manager + envoy-gateway | All namespaces | No |
| `cert-manager` | cert-manager | All namespaces | No |
| `external-secrets` | external-secrets | All namespaces | No |
| `cnpg-system` | cloudnative-pg | All namespaces | No |
| `strimzi-system` | strimzi-kafka | All namespaces | No |
| `redis-system` | redis-operator | All namespaces | No |
| `clickhouse-system` | clickhouse-operator | All namespaces | No |
| `keycloak-system` | keycloak-operator | All namespaces | No |
| `kube-system` | Kubernetes system | N/A | No |

### 2. Environment Namespaces (Workloads, Scalable)

These namespaces contain Custom Resources (workloads) managed by the operators:

| Namespace | Purpose | Dependencies | Can Scale to Zero? |
|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| `ameide-dev` | Development workloads | Operators | Yes |
| `ameide-staging` | Staging workloads | Operators | Yes |
| `ameide-prod` | Production workloads | Operators | Yes (not recommended) |

### 3. Tenant Namespaces (Future)

For namespace-per-tenant deployments:

| Namespace | Purpose | Dependencies | Can Scale to Zero? |
|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| `tenant-<id>-prod` | Tenant production | Operators | Per-tenant decision |

## Key Principles

### Principle 1: Operators are Cluster-Scoped

Operators deploy ONCE per cluster and watch ALL namespaces:

```
✅ CORRECT: One operator watches all environments

   cnpg-system namespace:
   └── cloudnative-pg operator (watches: *)
           │
           │ Manages Cluster CRs in:
           ├── ameide-dev
           ├── ameide-staging
           └── ameide-prod

❌ WRONG: Operator per environment (causes conflicts)

   ameide-dev:
   └── cloudnative-pg operator ──┐
                                 │ CONFLICT!
   ameide-staging:               │ Same webhooks,
   └── cloudnative-pg operator ──┘ ClusterRoles
```

### Principle 2: Workloads are Environment-Scoped

Custom Resources (the actual databases, caches, etc.) deploy per environment:

```yaml
# ameide-dev namespace
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: postgres-ameide
  namespace: ameide-dev  # ← Environment-scoped
spec:
  instances: 3
  storage:
    size: 10Gi
```

### Principle 3: Data Isolation via Namespaces

Each environment has completely isolated data:

| Resource | Dev | Staging | Prod |
|----------|-----|---------|------|
| PostgreSQL data | `ameide-dev/postgres-*` | `ameide-staging/postgres-*` | `ameide-prod/postgres-*` |
| Kafka topics | `ameide-dev/kafka-*` | `ameide-staging/kafka-*` | `ameide-prod/kafka-*` |
| Redis data | `ameide-dev/redis-*` | `ameide-staging/redis-*` | `ameide-prod/redis-*` |
| Vault secrets | `ameide-dev/vault` | `ameide-staging/vault` | `ameide-prod/vault` |

### Principle 4: ArgoCD Independence

ArgoCD has its own isolated cert-manager and envoy-gateway to avoid dependency on any environment:

```
argocd namespace:
├── argocd-server
├── argocd-repo-server
├── argocd-application-controller
├── argocd-cert-manager (isolated instance)
├── envoy-gateway (isolated controller for cluster gateway)
├── argocd-ameide-io-tls (certificate)
└── cluster-gateway (Gateway + HTTPRoute for argocd.ameide.io)
```

### Principle 5: CRDs are Cluster-Scoped

CRDs must be installed once per cluster, separate from operators:

```
✅ CORRECT: CRDs managed by cluster ApplicationSet

   cluster-crds-gateway (ArgoCD App)
   └── Gateway API CRDs (installed once)
           │
           │ Used by controllers in:
           ├── argocd (cluster-gateway)
           ├── ameide-dev (envoy-gateway)
           ├── ameide-staging (envoy-gateway)
           └── ameide-prod (envoy-gateway)

❌ WRONG: CRDs bundled in each Helm chart

   argocd/cluster-gateway (Helm chart with CRDs)
   ameide-dev/envoy-gateway (Helm chart with CRDs)
   ameide-staging/envoy-gateway (Helm chart with CRDs)
   └── CRD version conflicts and ownership issues
```

When including Helm charts that bundle CRDs (like Envoy Gateway), use `skipCrds: true`:

```yaml
# argocd/applications/cluster-gateway.yaml
helm:
  releaseName: cluster-gateway
  skipCrds: true  # CRDs managed by cluster ApplicationSet
```

## ApplicationSet Architecture

### Two ApplicationSets

```yaml
# 1. Cluster ApplicationSet (operators + CRDs)
argocd/applicationsets/cluster.yaml
  generators:
    - git:
        files:
          - path: environments/_shared/components/cluster/**/component.yaml
  # Creates: cluster-cloudnative-pg, cluster-crds-cnpg, etc.

# 2. Environment ApplicationSet (workloads)
argocd/applicationsets/ameide.yaml
  generators:
    - matrix:
        generators:
          - list:
              elements:
                - env: dev
                  namespace: ameide-dev
                - env: staging
                  namespace: ameide-staging
                - env: production
                  namespace: ameide-prod
          - git:
              files:
                - path: environments/_shared/components/**/component.yaml
  # Creates: dev-data-postgres-cluster, staging-data-postgres-cluster, etc.
```

### Component Directory Structure

```
environments/_shared/components/
├── cluster/                    # Cluster-scoped (deployed once)
│   ├── crds/                   # CRDs for all operators

    └── ...
```

## Rollout Order

### Cluster ApplicationSet (rollout-phase)

```
010: CRDs (all CRDs deployed first)
020: Operators (all operators deployed after CRDs)
030: Post-operator config (if any)
```

### Environment ApplicationSet (rollout-phase)

```
010: Namespace creation (foundation-namespaces)
130: Secret infrastructure (vault-webhook-certs)
140: Configs (coredns-config, managed-storage)
150: State stores (vault-core)
199: Foundation smoke tests
250: Data workloads (postgres-cluster, kafka-cluster, redis-failover)
350: Platform workloads (envoy-gateway, keycloak, prometheus)
650: Application workloads (www-ameide, inference, agents)
```

## Why This Architecture?

### Problem with Per-Environment Operators

Kubernetes operators create **cluster-scoped resources** with hardcoded names:

| Resource Type | Example Name | Conflict? |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| MutatingWebhookConfiguration | `cnpg-mutating-webhook-configuration` | Yes - only one can exist |
| ValidatingWebhookConfiguration | `cnpg-validating-webhook-configuration` | Yes - only one can exist |
| ClusterRole | `cloudnative-pg` | Yes - ArgoCD ownership conflict |
| ClusterRoleBinding | `cloudnative-pg` | Yes - ArgoCD ownership conflict |

If deployed per environment, these resources conflict with each other.

### Benefits of Cluster-Scoped Operators

1. **No resource conflicts** - Webhooks and ClusterRoles exist once
2. **Resource efficiency** - One operator pod instead of three
3. **Simpler RBAC** - One ClusterRole per operator
4. **Standard pattern** - How Kubernetes operators are designed to work
5. **Independent scaling** - Environment namespaces can scale to zero without affecting operators

## Network Isolation

### NetworkPolicy for Environment Namespaces

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-cross-environment
  namespace: ameide-dev
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    # Allow from same namespace
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              ameide.io/environment: dev
    # Allow from argocd (GitOps)
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: argocd
    # Allow from operator namespaces
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: cnpg-system
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: strimzi-system
    # ... other operators
```

## Failure Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Operator Namespace Down

**Impact:**
- Operator cannot reconcile CRs in any environment
- New CRs won't be processed
- Existing workloads continue running (pods persist)

**Not Impacted:**
- Running databases, caches, etc. (stateful workloads)
- Application traffic

**Recovery:**
- ArgoCD auto-heals operator deployment

### Scenario 2: Environment Namespace Down

**Impact:**
- That environment's workloads unavailable
- Applications in that environment down

**Not Impacted:**
- Other environments (completely isolated)
- Operators (in separate namespaces)
- ArgoCD (independent)

### Scenario 3: CRDs Deleted

**Impact:**
- All operators fail to reconcile
- CR resources become orphaned

**Recovery:**
1. ArgoCD syncs `cluster-crds-*` applications
2. CRDs restored
3. Operators resume reconciliation

## Implementation Checklist

## Summary

This document tracks the comprehensive effort to add tolerations and nodeSelector to all third-party Helm charts. While custom application charts inherit tolerations from `globals.yaml`, third-party charts require explicit configuration at chart-specific value paths.

**Status**: ✅ Complete (2025-12-05)

---

## Problem Statement

After deploying the 4-pool AKS strategy (system/dev/staging/prod), many pods remained in `Pending` state because:

1. **Third-party charts don't inherit globals.yaml**: Unlike custom app charts that use `{{ .Values.tolerations }}`, third-party charts have their own value structures
2. **Chart-specific value paths**: Each chart defines tolerations at different paths (e.g., `controller.tolerations`, `singleBinary.tolerations`, `deployment.pod.tolerations`)
3. **Subcomponents missed**: Charts with multiple components (operators, workers, web UIs) require tolerations at each subcomponent path
4. **Environment files missing**: Staging and production had fewer overrides than dev, causing inconsistent behavior

### Symptoms

```bash
# Pods stuck in Pending
kubectl get pods -n ameide-dev | grep Pending

# Example output before fix:
alloy-logs-89f774c98-k6vts           0/2     Pending   0     15h

```

### Root Cause

Pods without `tolerations` for `ameide.io/environment` cannot be scheduled on tainted node pools:

```bash
# Node taints (example: dev pool)
kubectl describe node aks-dev-21365390-vmss000000 | grep Taints
Taints: ameide.io/environment=dev:NoSchedule
```

---

## Solution Overview

For each third-party chart:

1. **Identify the correct tolerations path** by reading the chart's `values.yaml`
2. **Create/update per-environment values files** at `sources/values/{dev,staging,production}/...`
3. **Apply consistent pattern**:
   ```yaml
   # Pattern for most charts
   <component>:
     tolerations:
       - key: "ameide.io/environment"
         value: "<env>"        # dev, staging, or production
         effect: "NoSchedule"
     nodeSelector:
       ameide.io/pool: <pool>  # dev, staging, or prod
   ```

---

## Charts Fixed

### 1. Grafana Alloy (Logs)

**Chart**: `grafana/alloy` (sources/charts/third_party/grafana/alloy)

**Issue**: Values were at `alloy.tolerations` but chart expects `controller.tolerations`

**Correct path**:
```yaml
# sources/values/{env}/observability/platform-alloy-logs.yaml
controller:
  tolerations:
    - key: "ameide.io/environment"
      value: "dev"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    ameide.io/pool: dev
```

**Files modified**:
- `sources/values/dev/observability/platform-alloy-logs.yaml` (fixed path)
- `sources/values/staging/observability/platform-alloy-logs.yaml` (created)
- `sources/values/production/observability/platform-alloy-logs.yaml` (created)

---

### 2. Grafana Loki

**Chart**: `grafana/loki` (sources/charts/third_party/grafana/loki)

**Issue**: Values were at `loki.tolerations` but chart expects different paths for different modes

**Correct paths** (for singleBinary mode):
```yaml
# sources/values/{env}/observability/platform-loki.yaml
singleBinary:
  tolerations:
    - key: "ameide.io/environment"
      value: "dev"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    ameide.io/pool: dev

gateway:
  tolerations:
    - key: "ameide.io/environment"
      value: "dev"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    ameide.io/pool: dev
```

**Files modified**:
- `sources/values/dev/observability/platform-loki.yaml` (fixed path)
- `sources/values/staging/observability/platform-loki.yaml` (created)
- `sources/values/production/observability/platform-loki.yaml` (created)

---

### 3. Envoy Gateway

**Chart**: `envoy-gateway/gateway-helm` (sources/charts/third_party/envoy-gateway)

**Issue**: Values were at `deployment.envoyGateway.tolerations` but chart expects `deployment.pod.tolerations`

**Correct path**:
```yaml
# sources/values/{env}/platform/platform-envoy-gateway.yaml
deployment:
  pod:
    tolerations:
      - key: "ameide.io/environment"
        value: "dev"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
    nodeSelector:
      ameide.io/pool: dev
```

**Files modified**:
- `sources/values/dev/platform/platform-envoy-gateway.yaml` (fixed path)
- `sources/values/staging/platform/platform-envoy-gateway.yaml` (created)
- `sources/values/production/platform/platform-envoy-gateway.yaml` (created)

---

### 4. Temporal

**Chart**: `temporal/temporal` (sources/charts/third_party/temporal)

**Issue**: No environment-specific values files existed for staging/production. Temporal has many subcomponents.

**Correct paths** (multiple components):
```yaml
# sources/values/{env}/data/data-temporal.yaml
server:
  tolerations:
    - key: "ameide.io/environment"
      value: "dev"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    ameide.io/pool: dev
  frontend:
    tolerations: [...]
    nodeSelector: {...}
  history:
    tolerations: [...]
    nodeSelector: {...}
  matching:
    tolerations: [...]
    nodeSelector: {...}
  worker:
    tolerations: [...]
    nodeSelector: {...}

admintools:
  tolerations: [...]
  nodeSelector: {...}

web:
  tolerations: [...]
  nodeSelector: {...}
```

**Files modified**:
- `sources/values/dev/data/data-temporal.yaml` (already existed, verified correct)
- `sources/values/staging/data/data-temporal.yaml` (created)
- `sources/values/production/data/data-temporal.yaml` (created)

---

### 5. Langfuse

**Chart**: `langfuse/langfuse` (sources/charts/third_party/langfuse)

**Issue**: No environment-specific values files existed for dev.

**Correct path**:
```yaml
# sources/values/{env}/observability/platform-langfuse.yaml
langfuse:
  tolerations:
    - key: "ameide.io/environment"
      value: "dev"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    ameide.io/pool: dev
```

**Files modified**:
- `sources/values/dev/observability/platform-langfuse.yaml` (created - was using _shared only)
- `sources/values/staging/observability/platform-langfuse.yaml` (created)
- `sources/values/production/observability/platform-langfuse.yaml` (created)

**Image Path Note**: The Langfuse chart expects image repositories at:
- `langfuse.web.image.repository` (for web pods)
- `langfuse.worker.image.repository` (for worker pods)

NOT at `langfuse.image.repository` (which only sets global tag/pullSecrets). Fixed in commit `8ffc0e0`.

---

### 6. Prometheus (kube-prometheus-stack)

**Chart**: `prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack` (sources/charts/third_party/prometheus)

**Issue**: Multiple subcomponents, and prometheus-node-exporter is a DaemonSet requiring special handling

**Correct paths**:
```yaml
# sources/values/{env}/observability/platform-prometheus.yaml
prometheus:
  prometheusSpec:
    tolerations:
      - key: "ameide.io/environment"
        value: "dev"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
    nodeSelector:
      ameide.io/pool: dev

alertmanager:
  alertmanagerSpec:
    tolerations: [...]
    nodeSelector: {...}

prometheusOperator:
  tolerations: [...]
  nodeSelector: {...}

kube-state-metrics:
  tolerations: [...]
  nodeSelector: {...}

grafana:
  tolerations: [...]
  nodeSelector: {...}

# IMPORTANT: Each environment runs node-exporter on its own nodes only
# Using operator: "Exists" across all environments causes hostPort 9100 conflicts
prometheus-node-exporter:
  tolerations:
    - key: "ameide.io/environment"
      value: "dev"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    ameide.io/pool: dev
```

**DaemonSet Correction**: Originally documented as using `operator: "Exists"` to run on all nodes. This causes **hostPort 9100 conflicts** when multiple environments deploy node-exporter to the same cluster. Each environment's node-exporter must use `nodeSelector` to run only on its own node pool. Fixed in commit `1beb8cc`.

**Files modified**:
- `sources/values/dev/observability/platform-prometheus.yaml` (added node-exporter)
- `sources/values/staging/observability/platform-prometheus.yaml` (created)
- `sources/values/production/observability/platform-prometheus.yaml` (created)

---

### 7. Plausible

**Chart**: `plausible/plausible` (sources/charts/platform-layers/plausible)

**Issue**: Chart accepts tolerations at root level, but no environment files existed.

**Correct path**:
```yaml
# sources/values/{env}/apps/plausible.yaml
tolerations:
  - key: "ameide.io/environment"
    value: "dev"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
nodeSelector:
  ameide.io/pool: dev
```

**Files modified**:
- `sources/values/dev/apps/plausible.yaml` (created)
- `sources/values/staging/apps/plausible.yaml` (created)
- `sources/values/production/apps/plausible.yaml` (created)

---

### 8. Strimzi Kafka Operator

**Chart**: `strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator` (sources/charts/third_party/strimzi)

**Issue**: Dev file was minimal placeholder. Chart accepts tolerations at root level.

**Correct path**:
```yaml
# sources/values/{env}/data/foundation-strimzi-operator.yaml
tolerations:
  - key: "ameide.io/environment"
    value: "dev"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
nodeSelector:
  ameide.io/pool: dev
```

**Files modified**:
- `sources/values/dev/data/foundation-strimzi-operator.yaml` (updated from placeholder)
- `sources/values/staging/data/foundation-strimzi-operator.yaml` (created)
- `sources/values/production/data/foundation-strimzi-operator.yaml` (created)

---

### 9. Kafka Cluster (Strimzi CR)

**Chart**: Custom chart wrapping Strimzi Kafka CR (sources/charts/data/kafka-cluster)

**Issue**: No staging/production values files existed. Strimzi uses `template.pod.tolerations` inside the Kafka CR.

**Correct paths** (Strimzi CR format):
```yaml
# sources/values/{env}/data/data-kafka-cluster.yaml
kafka:
  template:
    pod:
      tolerations:
        - key: "ameide.io/environment"
          value: "dev"
          effect: "NoSchedule"
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
              - matchExpressions:
                  - key: ameide.io/pool
                    operator: In
                    values:
                      - dev

zookeeper:
  template:
    pod:
      tolerations: [...]
      affinity: {...}

entityOperator:
  template:
    pod:
      tolerations: [...]
      affinity: {...}
```

**Note**: Strimzi CRs use `affinity.nodeAffinity` instead of `nodeSelector` for pod placement.

**Files modified**:
- `sources/values/dev/data/data-kafka-cluster.yaml` (already existed, verified correct)
- `sources/values/staging/data/data-kafka-cluster.yaml` (created)
- `sources/values/production/data/data-kafka-cluster.yaml` (created)

---

### 10. Redis Failover (Spotahome Operator)

**Chart**: `spotahome/redis-operator` RedisFailover CR (sources/charts/data/redis-failover)

**Issue**: Staging and production had no environment-specific values files. Redis and Sentinel pods remained Pending.

**Correct paths**:
```yaml
# sources/values/{env}/data/data-redis-failover.yaml
redis:
  tolerations:
    - key: "ameide.io/environment"
      value: "dev"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    ameide.io/pool: dev

sentinel:
  tolerations:
    - key: "ameide.io/environment"
      value: "dev"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    ameide.io/pool: dev
```

**Files modified**:
- `sources/values/dev/data/data-redis-failover.yaml` (already existed)
- `sources/values/staging/data/data-redis-failover.yaml` (created)
- `sources/values/production/data/data-redis-failover.yaml` (created)

---

### 11. Langfuse Bootstrap

**Chart**: Custom chart (sources/charts/platform-layers/langfuse-bootstrap)

**Issue**: Bootstrap job (ArgoCD PostSync hook) had no tolerations, causing jobs to stay Pending in all environments.

**Correct path**:
```yaml
# sources/values/{env}/platform/platform-langfuse-bootstrap.yaml
tolerations:
  - key: "ameide.io/environment"
    value: "dev"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
nodeSelector:
  ameide.io/pool: dev
```

**Files modified**:
- `sources/values/dev/platform/platform-langfuse-bootstrap.yaml` (updated)
- `sources/values/staging/platform/platform-langfuse-bootstrap.yaml` (created)
- `sources/values/production/platform/platform-langfuse-bootstrap.yaml` (created)

## Verification

### Before Fix

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ameide-dev | grep Pending | wc -l
# 17+ pods pending
```

### After Fix

```bash
# Pods now scheduling on correct node pools

# Verify tolerations applied
kubectl get pod platform-langfuse-web-67b8c44785-pxcph -n ameide-dev -o yaml | grep -A3 tolerations
tolerations:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: ameide.io/environment
    value: dev
```

---

## Reference: Finding Correct Tolerations Paths

When adding a new third-party chart, follow this process:

### Step 1: Find the chart's values.yaml

```bash
# Example for Alloy
cat sources/charts/third_party/grafana/alloy/*/values.yaml | grep -A5 tolerations
```

### Step 2: Identify the correct path

Common patterns:
| Chart Type | Typical Path |
|------------|--------------|
| Simple deployment | `tolerations:` (root) |
| Controller-based | `controller.tolerations:` |
| Multi-component | `<component>.tolerations:` per component |
| Nested spec | `<component>.<spec>.tolerations:` |
| CRD-based (Strimzi) | `<resource>.template.pod.tolerations:` |

### Step 3: Create per-environment files

```bash
# Template for new chart
for env in dev staging production; do
  cat > sources/values/$env/<layer>/<chart>.yaml << 'EOF'
# ${env^}-specific values for <chart>

# Tolerations for $env node pool - see backlog/442-environment-isolation.md
<path>:
  tolerations:
    - key: "ameide.io/environment"
      value: "$env"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    ameide.io/pool: $pool
EOF
done
```

## Outstanding Items

### Not Applicable / Already Handled

| Chart | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| MinIO | ✅ Fixed in 442 | `console.tolerations`, `provisioning.tolerations` |
| ClickHouse | ✅ Fixed in 442 | `clickhouse.tolerations` |
| CNPG Postgres | ✅ Fixed in 442 | `cluster.affinity.tolerations` |
| Custom app charts (14) | ✅ Inherit | Use `{{ .Values.tolerations }}` from globals.yaml |

### Future Considerations

1. **New third-party charts**: When adding new charts, always check tolerations path
2. **Chart upgrades**: Major version upgrades may change tolerations paths
3. **DaemonSets with hostPort**: Restrict to per-environment nodeSelector to avoid port conflicts (e.g., prometheus-node-exporter uses hostPort 9100)
4. **GHCR mirrors**: Docker Hub images should be mirrored to GHCR to avoid rate limiting - see [456-ghcr-mirror.md](456-ghcr-mirror.md)

## Related Issues

- Temporal pods in CrashLoopBackOff are **not** toleration issues - they are application-level errors

# ArgoCD Rollout Phases v3: Dual ApplicationSet Architecture

**Status**: Implemented
**Supersedes**: 387-argocd-waves-v2.md (partially - phase numbering retained, architecture updated)
**Related**: [446-namespace-isolation.md](446-namespace-isolation.md), [448-per-environment-service-verification.md](448-per-environment-service-verification.md), [449-per-environment-infrastructure.md](449-per-environment-infrastructure.md), [452-observability-namespace-isolation.md](452-observability-namespace-isolation.md), [455-traffic-manager-ignoredifferences.md](455-traffic-manager-ignoredifferences.md), [456-ghcr-mirror.md](456-ghcr-mirror.md)

## Problem Statement

The v2 design (387) assumed operators could be deployed per-environment using a single ApplicationSet. This caused:

1. **ClusterRole conflicts**: Operators create ClusterRoles with hardcoded names (e.g., `cloudnative-pg`). Multiple environments deploying the same operator created conflicts.
2. **Webhook conflicts**: MutatingWebhookConfiguration/ValidatingWebhookConfiguration resources are cluster-scoped with fixed names.
3. **ArgoCD ownership conflicts**: Multiple Applications trying to manage the same cluster-scoped resource causes sync failures.
4. **Resource waste**: Running 3 copies of each operator (dev/staging/production) when one suffices.

## Solution: Dual ApplicationSet Model

Split deployment into two ApplicationSets:

| ApplicationSet | Scope | Deploys | Namespace Pattern |
|----------------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `cluster` | Cluster-wide | CRDs, Operators | `-system` namespaces |
| `ameide` | Per-environment | Workloads (CRs) | `ameide-{env}` |

### Cluster ApplicationSet (`argocd/applicationsets/cluster.yaml`)

Deploys resources that are **cluster-scoped by nature**:
- CRDs (CustomResourceDefinitions are always cluster-scoped)
- Operators (create ClusterRoles, Webhooks, watch multiple namespaces)

```yaml
generators:
  - git:
      files:
        - path: environments/_shared/components/cluster/**/component.yaml
strategy:
  type: RollingSync
  rollingSync:
    steps:
      - maxUpdate: 10  # CRDs first
        matchExpressions:
          - key: rollout-phase
            operator: In
            values: ["010"]
      - maxUpdate: 5   # Operators
        matchExpressions:
          - key: rollout-phase
            operator: In
            values: ["020"]
```

### Environment ApplicationSet (`argocd/applicationsets/ameide.yaml`)

Deploys **environment-scoped workloads** (Custom Resources managed by the cluster operators):
- Database clusters (CNPG Cluster, ClickHouseInstallation, RedisFailover)
- Kafka clusters (Kafka CR)
- Keycloak instances (Keycloak CR)
- Application deployments

```yaml
generators:
  - matrix:
      generators:
        - list:
            elements:
              - env: dev
                namespace: ameide-dev
              - env: staging
                namespace: ameide-staging
              - env: production
                namespace: ameide-prod
        - git:
            files:
              - path: environments/_shared/components/apps/**/component.yaml
              - path: environments/_shared/components/data/**/component.yaml
              - path: environments/_shared/components/foundation/**/component.yaml
              - path: environments/_shared/components/platform/**/component.yaml
```

```

## Operator Namespace Strategy

Each operator deploys to a dedicated `-system` namespace:

| Operator | Namespace | Watches |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| CloudNative-PG | `cnpg-system` | All namespaces |
| Strimzi | `strimzi-system` | All namespaces |
| ClickHouse | `clickhouse-system` | All namespaces |
| Redis | `redis-system` | All namespaces |
| Keycloak | `keycloak-system` | All namespaces |
| cert-manager | `cert-manager` | All namespaces |
| external-secrets | `external-secrets` | All namespaces |

Operators are configured with `watchNamespaces: []` (empty = all namespaces) so they can manage CRs in any environment namespace.

## Node Tolerations

Cluster nodes have environment-specific taints:
- `ameide.io/environment: dev`
- `ameide.io/environment: staging`
- `ameide.io/environment: production`
- `CriticalAddonsOnly: true` (system nodes)

Cluster-scoped operators run on system nodes with `CriticalAddonsOnly` toleration:

```yaml
tolerations:
  - key: CriticalAddonsOnly
    operator: Exists
```

## Rollout Phase Bands

### Cluster Phases (000-099)

| Phase | Type | Components |
|-------|------|------------|
| 010 | CRDs | All CRDs (cert-manager, cnpg, clickhouse, external-secrets, gateway-api, keycloak, prometheus, redis, strimzi) |
| 020 | Operators | All operators (cert-manager, cloudnative-pg, clickhouse, external-secrets, keycloak, redis, strimzi) |
| 030 | Post-operator config | Reserved for cluster-wide configs |

### Environment Phases (100-699)

Retained from v2 design for workloads:

| Band | Purpose | Phases |
|------|---------|--------|
| Foundation | Core infrastructure | 100-199 |
| Data | Database/messaging workloads | 200-299 |
| Platform | Platform services | 300-399 |
| Data Extended | Temporal, etc. | 400-499 |
| Observability | Monitoring/logging | 500-599 |
| Apps | Application workloads | 600-699 |

Within each band:
- `*10`: CRDs (environment-specific, if any)
- `*20`: Controllers (environment-specific, if any)
- `*30`: Secrets
- `*40`: Configs/bootstraps
- `*50`: Runtimes/workloads
- `*55`: Post-runtime bootstraps
- `*99`: Smokes

## Deployment Order

1. **Cluster ApplicationSet syncs first** (sync-wave: -1)
   - Phase 010: All CRDs installed
   - Phase 020: All operators running in `-system` namespaces

2. **Environment ApplicationSet syncs second** (sync-wave: 0)
   - Phases 100+: Workloads deployed per-environment
   - Operators already running, ready to reconcile CRs

## Key Differences from v2

| Aspect | v2 (387) | v3 (447) |
|--------|----------|----------|
| ApplicationSets | 1 (single) | 2 (cluster + ameide) |
| Operator deployment | Per-environment | Once per cluster |
| Operator namespaces | `ameide-{env}` | `-system` namespaces |
| CRD ownership | Per-environment apps | Single cluster app |
| Phase 010-020 | Prereqs in ameide | Dedicated cluster scope |
| Phase 110-120 | Foundation CRDs/operators | Workloads only (operators moved to cluster) |

## Migration Notes

When migrating from v2:
1. Create `cluster` ApplicationSet
2. Move operators from `environments/_shared/components/foundation/operators/` to `environments/_shared/components/cluster/operators/`
3. Move CRDs from domain-specific locations to `environments/_shared/components/cluster/crds/`
4. Update `ameide.yaml` to exclude `cluster/` directory
5. Delete old per-environment operator Applications
6. Add tolerations to operator values for node scheduling

## Validation

Check cluster operators are running:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n cnpg-system
kubectl get pods -n strimzi-system
kubectl get pods -n clickhouse-system
kubectl get pods -n redis-system
kubectl get pods -n keycloak-system
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
kubectl get pods -n external-secrets
```

Check ApplicationSets:
```bash
kubectl get applicationsets -n argocd
# Should show: cluster, ameide
```

Check cluster apps:
```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd -l scope=cluster
```

## Troubleshooting

### Altinity ClickHouse Operator CHI Informer Issue (2025-12-05)

**Symptom**: CHIs exist but have empty `.status`, no StatefulSets created, operator logs show no `chiInformer` events.

**Root cause**: The Helm-deployed operator in `clickhouse-system` had a broken CHI informer. Operator logs showed:
- `podInformer.AddFunc/UpdateFunc` ✓
- `configMapInformer.AddFunc` ✓
- `endpointSliceInformer.UpdateFunc` ✓
- **No `chiInformer` events at all** ✗

The CHI controller workers started but never received any work items.

**Resolution**: Reinstall from official bundle instead of Helm chart:

```bash
# Install from official bundle (goes to kube-system namespace by default)
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Altinity/clickhouse-operator/0.25.5/deploy/operator/clickhouse-operator-install-bundle.yaml

# Delete the broken Helm-managed operator
kubectl delete deployment clickhouse-operator -n clickhouse-system

# Add CriticalAddonsOnly toleration for system node scheduling
kubectl patch deployment clickhouse-operator -n kube-system --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/template/spec/tolerations", "value": [{"key": "CriticalAddonsOnly", "operator": "Exists"}]}]'
```

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check operator is processing CHIs (should see ENQUEUE lines)
kubectl logs -n kube-system deployment/clickhouse-operator | grep -E "ENQUEUE.*ReconcileCHI"

# Check CHI status (should not be empty)
kubectl get chi -A

# Check StatefulSets created with correct tolerations
kubectl get sts -n ameide-dev -l clickhouse.altinity.com/chi=data-clickhouse
kubectl get sts <name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.tolerations}' | jq .
```

**Key difference**: The official bundle creates informers correctly; the Helm chart deployment had a broken informer initialization path. After fix, CHI dev completed in ~1 minute with correct tolerations propagated to StatefulSet/Pod.

### CNPG Postgres Affinity Configuration

CNPG uses `spec.affinity` (not `spec.tolerations`) on the Cluster CR:

```yaml
# Correct structure per CloudNativePG docs
cluster:
  affinity:
    tolerations:
      - key: "ameide.io/environment"
        value: "dev"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
    nodeSelector:
      ameide.io/pool: dev
```

## 448-cert-manager-workload-identity.md

# 448: Cert-Manager Workload Identity Architecture

## Status: Implemented

## Problem

Cert-manager needs Azure Workload Identity to authenticate with Azure DNS for ACME DNS-01 challenges. The client ID must be set as an annotation on the ServiceAccount.

**Challenges:**
1. cert-manager Helm chart has strict JSON schema validation - rejects unknown fields like `azure`
2. Using `excludeGlobals: true` means globals.yaml isn't available for templating
3. Hardcoding client IDs in values files breaks the Terraform → GitOps data flow

## Solution

Externalize ServiceAccount management following vendor recommendations:
- [cert-manager Best Practice](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/best-practice/)
- [Azure Workload Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview)

```

### Key Components

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| cert-manager-wi chart | `sources/charts/foundation/operators-config/cert-manager-wi/` | Creates SAs with WI annotations |
| cert-manager-wi component | `environments/_shared/components/foundation/operators-config/cert-manager-wi/` | ArgoCD app definition |
| cert-manager values | `sources/values/_shared/foundation/foundation-cert-manager.yaml` | `serviceAccount.create: false` |

### Helm Values Configuration

**cert-manager-wi chart** (our chart, accepts globals):
```yaml
azure:
  dnsManagedIdentityClientId: "{{ from globals.yaml }}"
```

**cert-manager chart** (third-party, strict schema):
```yaml
# Per-environment naming for complete RBAC isolation
fullnameOverride: cert-manager-dev  # cert-manager-staging, cert-manager-prod

serviceAccount:
  create: false  # Don't create, use external SA
  name: cert-manager-dev  # cert-manager-staging, cert-manager-prod
```

## Rollout Order

1. **Phase 115**: `foundation-cert-manager-wi` - Creates ServiceAccounts
2. **Phase 120**: `foundation-cert-manager` - Deploys cert-manager using those SAs

## Verification

```bash
# Check SA has correct client ID from globals (per-environment)
kubectl get sa cert-manager-dev -n ameide-dev \
  -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.azure\.workload\.identity/client-id}'
kubectl get sa cert-manager-staging -n ameide-staging \
  -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.azure\.workload\.identity/client-id}'
kubectl get sa cert-manager-prod -n ameide-prod \
  -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.azure\.workload\.identity/client-id}'

# Check pods have WI env vars injected (per-environment)
kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=dev-foundation-cert-manager -n ameide-dev \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.containers[0].env[*].name}'
# Should include: AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE
```

## DNS-01 Issuer Pattern

We use **namespaced Issuer** (not ClusterIssuer) for DNS-01 challenges with Azure Workload Identity due to our multi-identity architecture:

**Why Issuer instead of ClusterIssuer:**
- Each environment has its own cert-manager instance with isolated Workload Identity
- ClusterIssuer requires a single controller to process challenges from all environments
- That single controller's ServiceAccount would need access to all per-env managed identities
- Namespaced Issuer + `--issuer-ambient-credentials=true` allows each env's controller to use its own identity

**Configuration pattern:**
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-dev-dns01
  namespace: ameide-dev
spec:
  acme:
    email: admin@ameide.io
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-dev-dns01-key
    solvers:
    - dns01:
        azureDNS:
          hostedZoneName: dev.ameide.io
          resourceGroupName: Ameide
          subscriptionID: "..."
          environment: AzurePublicCloud
          managedIdentity:
            clientID: "<MI client ID from globals.yaml>"
```

**Certificate resources** reference the Issuer:
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
spec:
  issuerRef:
    kind: Issuer  # Namespace-scoped
    name: letsencrypt-dev-dns01
```

**Required controller args:**
```yaml
extraArgs:
  - --namespace=$(POD_NAMESPACE)  # Only watch own namespace
  - --issuer-ambient-credentials=true  # Enable WI for Issuers
```

## Per-Environment RBAC Isolation

Each environment uses a unique `fullnameOverride` to ensure complete RBAC isolation:

| Environment | fullnameOverride | ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding prefix |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| dev | `cert-manager-dev` | `cert-manager-dev-*` |
| staging | `cert-manager-staging` | `cert-manager-staging-*` |
| prod | `cert-manager-prod` | `cert-manager-prod-*` |

**Why per-environment naming:**
- Helm generates ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings using `fullnameOverride`
- Multiple releases with the same name would overwrite each other's cluster-scoped resources
- The last ArgoCD sync "wins", leaving other environments' SAs without RBAC permissions
- Per-env naming creates unique cluster-scoped resources that don't conflict

**Federated credential subjects** (in Bicep/Terraform):
```
argocd:  system:serviceaccount:argocd:argocd-cert-manager
dev:     system:serviceaccount:ameide-dev:cert-manager-dev
staging: system:serviceaccount:ameide-staging:cert-manager-staging
prod:    system:serviceaccount:ameide-prod:cert-manager-prod
```

## 448-per-environment-service-verification.md

# 448 – Per-Environment Service Verification

**Status**: Complete
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Updated**: 2025-12-05
**Related**: [445-argocd-namespace-isolation.md](445-argocd-namespace-isolation.md), [446-namespace-isolation.md](446-namespace-isolation.md), [447-waves-v3-cluster-scoped-operators.md](447-waves-v3-cluster-scoped-operators.md), [449-per-environment-infrastructure.md](449-per-environment-infrastructure.md)

---

## Problem Statement

Services running in environment-specific namespaces (`ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod`) require correct namespace-qualified FQDNs for cross-service communication. Hardcoded references to a non-existent `ameide` namespace cause connection failures.

---

## Completed Fixes

### Database Connection Strings

Removed fallback defaults from shared config and added explicit `postgresHost` per environment:

| Environment | File | Value |
|-------------|------|-------|
| dev | `sources/values/dev/foundation/foundation-vault-secrets-platform.yaml` | `postgres-ameide-rw.ameide-dev.svc.cluster.local` |
| staging | `sources/values/staging/apps/platform/vault-secrets-platform.yaml` | `postgres-ameide-rw.ameide-staging.svc.cluster.local` |
| production | `sources/values/production/apps/platform/vault-secrets-platform.yaml` | `postgres-ameide-rw.ameide-prod.svc.cluster.local` |

Shared config (`_shared/foundation/foundation-vault-secrets-platform.yaml`) now uses `.Values.postgresHost` directly without fallback.

### CoreDNS Configuration

Created per-environment CoreDNS configs with correct Envoy service references:

| Environment | File | Envoy Service |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| dev | `sources/values/dev/foundation/foundation-coredns-config.yaml` | `envoy.ameide-dev.svc.cluster.local` |
| staging | `sources/values/staging/foundation/foundation-coredns-config.yaml` | `envoy.ameide-staging.svc.cluster.local` |
| production | `sources/values/production/foundation/foundation-coredns-config.yaml` | `envoy.ameide-prod.svc.cluster.local` |

Updated platform coredns-config.yaml files:

| Environment | File | Value |
|-------------|------|-------|
| staging | `sources/values/staging/apps/platform/coredns-config.yaml` | `envoy.ameide-staging.svc.cluster.local` |
| production | `sources/values/production/apps/platform/coredns-config.yaml` | `envoy.ameide-prod.svc.cluster.local` |

Shared config (`_shared/foundation/foundation-coredns-config.yaml`) cleared - per-environment files now define rules.

### Gateway OTEL Endpoints

Per-environment gateway files use correct FQDNs:
- dev: `otel-collector.ameide-dev.svc.cluster.local`
- staging: `otel-collector.ameide-staging.svc.cluster.local`
- production: `otel-collector.ameide-prod.svc.cluster.local`

### Smoke Tests

Replaced 61 hardcoded `--namespace ameide` references with `{{ .Release.Namespace }}` across 8 files:

| File | Refs Fixed |
|------|-----------|
| `_shared/data/data-data-plane-smoke.yaml` | 17 |
| `_shared/platform/platform-observability-smoke.yaml` | 14 |
| `_shared/platform/platform-auth-smoke.yaml` | 10 |
| `_shared/data/data-data-plane-ext-smoke.yaml` | 9 |
| `_shared/platform/platform-control-plane-smoke.yaml` | 5 |
| `_shared/foundation/foundation-operators-smoke.yaml` | 3 |
| `_shared/platform/platform-secrets-smoke.yaml` | 2 |
| `_shared/foundation/foundation-bootstrap-smoke.yaml` | 1 |

### CNPG Monitoring ConfigMap

Fixed hardcoded `targetNamespace: ameide` in two values files (2025-12-05):

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `sources/values/_shared/foundation/foundation-cnpg-monitoring.yaml` | Removed `targetNamespace: ameide` |
| `sources/values/_shared/data/foundation-cnpg-monitoring.yaml` | Removed `targetNamespace: ameide` |

The template uses `{{ .Values.targetNamespace | default .Release.Namespace }}`, so removing `targetNamespace` allows per-environment deployment to correct namespaces.

**Commit**: `d65a48a` - fix(cnpg-monitoring): use Release.Namespace instead of hardcoded ameide

### ClickHouse Secrets ExternalSecret

Fixed hardcoded `secret.namespace` requirement (2025-12-05):

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `sources/charts/data/clickhouse-secrets/templates/externalsecret.yaml` | Changed `required "secret.namespace is required"` to `.Release.Namespace` |

**Commit**: `8b20254` - fix(clickhouse-secrets): use Release.Namespace instead of required

### Plausible ClickHouse Host

Fixed incorrect ClickHouse service name (2025-12-05):

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `sources/charts/platform-layers/plausible/values.yaml` | Changed `clickhouse-data-clickhouse` to `chi-data-clickhouse-data-clickhouse-0-0` |

The Altinity ClickHouse operator creates services with naming pattern: `chi-{chi-name}-{cluster-name}-{shard}-{replica}`

**Commit**: `8cf354f` - fix(plausible): correct ClickHouse service name for Altinity operator

## Remaining Work

### P2 - CI Validation

Add pre-commit or CI check to detect `.ameide.svc` patterns without environment qualification.

# 449 – Per-Environment Infrastructure

**Status**: Implemented
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Updated**: 2025-12-05
**Related**: [446-namespace-isolation.md](446-namespace-isolation.md), [447-waves-v3-cluster-scoped-operators.md](447-waves-v3-cluster-scoped-operators.md), [448-per-environment-service-verification.md](448-per-environment-service-verification.md), [451-secrets-management.md](451-secrets-management.md)

---

## Problem Statement

Infrastructure was designed for a single-environment cluster. With namespace isolation (446/447), workloads run in per-environment namespaces (`ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod`). Azure resources need corresponding per-environment instances.

---

## Resource Classification

### Cluster-Scoped (Shared)

| Resource | Namespace/Scope | Rationale |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| AKS Cluster | N/A | Single cluster, multi-environment |
| Key Vault | N/A | Shared secrets across environments (see [451](451-secrets-management.md)) |
| Log Analytics | N/A | Centralized observability |
| ArgoCD Public IP | `argocd` | Single ArgoCD instance |
| Vault Bootstrap Identity | Per-env federated | vault-bootstrap runs in each env namespace |
| DNS Identity | Multiple | Cert-manager shares DNS access |
| DNS Zones | N/A | Shared DNS infrastructure |

### Per-Environment

| Resource | Pattern | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Storage Account | `ameide{env}backup` | Backup isolation |
| Backup Identity | `ameide-{env}-backup-mi` | CNPG per-namespace |
| Envoy Public IP | `ameide-{env}-envoy-pip` | Ingress isolation |

---

## Implementation Status

### Terraform (`infra/terraform/azure/`) ✅

| Resource | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Storage Account | ✅ Per-environment (`for_each` over `env_namespaces`) |
| Backup Identity | ✅ Per-environment with correct federated credentials |
| Envoy IPs | ✅ Per-environment |

### Bicep (`infra/bicep/`) ✅

| Resource | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Storage Account | ✅ Per-environment (`[for ns in envNamespaces: ...]`) |
| Backup Identity | ✅ Per-environment with correct federated credentials |
| Envoy IPs | ✅ Per-environment |

---

## Implementation Details

### Key Vault (Cluster-Scoped)

Key Vault remains shared across environments. Secrets are namespaced by naming convention within the vault.

### Per-Environment Backup Infrastructure

```hcl
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "backup" {
  for_each = var.enable_backup_storage ? toset(local.environments) : toset([])

  name                     = lower(replace("${var.name_prefix}${each.key}backup", "-", ""))
  location                 = var.location
  resource_group_name      = data.azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = each.key == "prod" ? "GRS" : "LRS"
  min_tls_version          = "TLS1_2"

  blob_properties {
    versioning_enabled = true
  }

  tags = merge(local.base_tags, {
    ameide_io_environment = each.key
  })
}

module "backup_identity" {
  for_each = var.enable_backup_storage ? toset(local.environments) : toset([])
  source   = "../modules/azure-identity"

  name                = lower("${var.name_prefix}-${each.key}-backup-mi")
  location            = var.location
  resource_group_name = data.azurerm_resource_group.main.name

  federated_credentials = var.enable_backup_federated_identity ? {
    cnpg-backup = {
      issuer  = module.aks.oidc_issuer_url
      subject = "system:serviceaccount:ameide-${each.key}:postgres-ameide"
    }
  } : {}

  role_assignments = {
    storage-blob-contributor = {
      scope = azurerm_storage_account.backup[each.key].id
      role  = "Storage Blob Data Contributor"
    }
  }
}
```

### Outputs

```hcl
output "backup" {
  description = "Backup configuration per environment"
  value = {
    for env in local.env_namespaces : env => {
      storage_account_name  = var.enable_backup_storage ? azurerm_storage_account.backup[env].name : ""
      blob_endpoint         = var.enable_backup_storage ? azurerm_storage_account.backup[env].primary_blob_endpoint : ""
      identity_client_id    = var.enable_backup_storage ? module.backup_identity[env].client_id : ""
      identity_principal_id = var.enable_backup_storage ? module.backup_identity[env].principal_id : ""
    }
  }
}
```

### Federated Identity Subjects

Each environment's backup identity has a federated credential for the CNPG service account:

```hcl
cnpg_backup_subjects = {
  dev     = "system:serviceaccount:ameide-dev:postgres-ameide"
  staging = "system:serviceaccount:ameide-staging:postgres-ameide"
  prod    = "system:serviceaccount:ameide-prod:postgres-ameide"
}
```

### Vault Bootstrap Identity (Updated 2025-12-05)

The vault-bootstrap CronJob runs in per-environment namespaces (`ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod`) and needs Azure Workload Identity to fetch secrets from Key Vault. This requires federated credentials for each namespace:

```hcl
# infra/terraform/azure/main.tf
vault_bootstrap_subjects = {
  dev     = "system:serviceaccount:ameide-dev:foundation-vault-bootstrap-vault-bootstrap"
  staging = "system:serviceaccount:ameide-staging:foundation-vault-bootstrap-vault-bootstrap"
  prod    = "system:serviceaccount:ameide-prod:foundation-vault-bootstrap-vault-bootstrap"
}

module "vault_bootstrap_identity" {
  source = "../modules/azure-identity"

  name = "ameide-vault-bootstrap-mi"
  # ...

  federated_credentials = {
    for name, subject in local.vault_bootstrap_subjects : "vault-bootstrap-${name}" => {
      issuer  = module.aks.oidc_issuer_url
      subject = subject
    }
  }

  role_assignments = {
    keyvault-secrets-user = {
      scope = module.keyvault.id
      role  = "Key Vault Secrets User"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Without per-environment federated credentials, vault-bootstrap cannot authenticate to Azure Key Vault and falls back to placeholder secrets. See [451-secrets-management.md](451-secrets-management.md) for the full secrets flow.

---

## Migration

1. Apply infrastructure changes (creates per-env storage accounts and identities)
2. Update globals.yaml with per-environment backup values
3. Sync ArgoCD
4. Validate CNPG backups work in all environments

---

## Validation

```bash
# Storage Accounts (should show 3: ameidedevbackup, ameidestagingbackup, ameideprodbackup)
az storage account list -g Ameide \
  --query "[?contains(name,'backup')].{name:name,env:tags.ameide_io_environment}" -o table

# Federated Credentials (should show correct service account per env)
for env in dev staging prod; do
  echo "=== ${env} ==="
  az identity federated-credential list \
    --identity-name "ameide-${env}-backup-mi" \
    --resource-group Ameide \
    --query "[].{name:name, subject:subject}" -o table
done

# Terraform outputs
cd infra/terraform/azure && terraform output backup
```

## P0 – Blocking Issues (Root Cause Chain)

### 1. ~~Vault Pods Running with Outdated Revision~~ ✅ RESOLVED

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Pods deleted and recreated with correct tolerations

All Vault pods now running on correct environment nodes:
```
ameide-dev       foundation-vault-core-0   Running   aks-dev-21365390-vmss000001
ameide-staging   foundation-vault-core-0   Running   aks-staging-92300291-vmss000002
ameide-prod      foundation-vault-core-0   Running   aks-prod-23578083-vmss000000
```

### 1b. ~~Dev Node Volume Limit~~ ✅ RESOLVED

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Second dev node now Ready

---

### 2. ~~ClusterSecretStore Architecture Mismatch~~ ✅ RESOLVED

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Refactored to per-environment SecretStores (Option B)

**Original Issue**: ClusterSecretStore pointed to non-existent `vault` namespace, but Vault is deployed per-environment per backlog/446.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Replaced cluster-wide `ClusterSecretStore` with per-environment `SecretStore`
2. Each SecretStore points to local Vault: `foundation-vault-core.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local`
3. Updated 97 files to reference `SecretStore` instead of `ClusterSecretStore`
4. Deleted old `ClusterSecretStore` from cluster

**New Architecture** (aligned with 446):
```
ameide-dev namespace:
  └── SecretStore/ameide-vault → foundation-vault-core.ameide-dev.svc.cluster.local:8200

ameide-staging namespace:
  └── SecretStore/ameide-vault → foundation-vault-core.ameide-staging.svc.cluster.local:8200

ameide-prod namespace:
  └── SecretStore/ameide-vault → foundation-vault-core.ameide-prod.svc.cluster.local:8200
```

**Files Changed**:
- `sources/values/_shared/foundation/foundation-vault-secret-store.yaml` - Main SecretStore template
- `sources/values/_shared/foundation/foundation-vault-bootstrap.yaml` - Per-env Vault address
- `sources/charts/foundation/vault-bootstrap/templates/cronjob.yaml` - Use Release.Namespace
- `sources/charts/shared-values/tests/secrets-smoke.yaml` - Fix ClusterSecretStore refs
- All ExternalSecret references updated from `ClusterSecretStore` to `SecretStore`

**Additional Fix (2025-12-05)**:
- Removed `namespace` from serviceAccountRef (webhook validation error)
- Use `default` SA in each environment namespace
- Updated vault-bootstrap to accept SAs from `ameide-dev,ameide-staging,ameide-prod`

**Current State**: SecretStores created and synced:
```
kubectl get secretstores -A
NAMESPACE        NAME           AGE   STATUS   CAPABILITIES   READY
ameide-dev       ameide-vault   ...
ameide-prod      ameide-vault   ...
ameide-staging   ameide-vault   ...
```

**Next**: Vault initialization/unsealing required for SecretStores to become Ready

---

### 3. PVCs Pending

**Symptom**: Multiple PersistentVolumeClaims stuck in Pending

| PVC | Namespace | Storage Class | Reason |
|-----|-----------|---------------|--------|
| `data-foundation-vault-core-0` | ameide-dev | default | Pod not scheduled |
| `data-0-kafka-kafka-pool-0` | ameide-dev | managed-csi-premium | Pod not scheduled |
| `data-clickhouse-*` | ameide-dev | managed-csi | Pod not scheduled |
| `postgres-ameide-1` | ameide-dev | managed-csi-premium | Pod not scheduled |
| `storage-platform-loki-0` | ameide-dev | managed-csi | Pod not scheduled |

**Root Cause**: PVCs waiting for pods to be scheduled (WaitForFirstConsumer)

---

## P1 – Pod Failures (Blocked by P0)

### CreateContainerConfigError (Missing Secrets)

| Pod | Namespace | Missing Secret |
|-----|-----------|----------------|
| `data-minio-*` | ameide-dev | `minio-root-credentials` |
| `platform-grafana-*` | ameide-dev | `grafana-admin-credentials` |
| `pgadmin-*` | ameide-dev | `pgadmin-bootstrap-credentials` |
| `plausible-plausible-*` | ameide-dev | `plausible-secret` |

### ~~ImagePullBackOff (Missing ghcr-pull-secret)~~ ✅ RESOLVED

| Pod | Namespace | Image |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| `transformation-*` | ameide-dev | `ghcr.io/ameideio/transformation:dev` |

**Root Cause (Multi-Layer)**:
1. ClusterSecretStore broken → fixed with per-environment SecretStores
2. vault-bootstrap couldn't fetch secrets from Azure Key Vault → federated identity credentials were missing for per-environment namespaces

**Fix Applied (2025-12-05)**:
1. Created per-environment federated identity credentials for vault-bootstrap identity:
   - `vault-bootstrap-dev` → `system:serviceaccount:ameide-dev:foundation-vault-bootstrap-vault-bootstrap`
   - `vault-bootstrap-staging` → `system:serviceaccount:ameide-staging:foundation-vault-bootstrap-vault-bootstrap`
   - `vault-bootstrap-prod` → `system:serviceaccount:ameide-prod:foundation-vault-bootstrap-vault-bootstrap`
2. Updated Terraform to manage these federated credentials automatically
3. Removed `env-` prefix from Azure Key Vault secret names (aligned with Helm values)

**Result**: Real credentials now flow: `.env` → Azure Key Vault → HashiCorp Vault → ExternalSecrets → K8s Secrets

See [451-secrets-management.md](451-secrets-management.md) for complete secrets architecture

## P2 – OutOfSync Applications

### ~~Environment-Specific Apps~~ ✅ RESOLVED

| App | Status | Resolution |
|-----|--------|------------|
| `*-foundation-cert-manager` | ✅ DELETED | Orphaned apps deleted - cert-manager is cluster-scoped per 446 |
| `*-foundation-coredns-config` | Syncing | Will auto-sync |
| `*-foundation-cnpg-monitoring` | Synced | Fixed |
| `*-foundation-vault-bootstrap` | Synced | Fixed |
| `*-platform-envoy-gateway` | Syncing | Will auto-sync |
| `*-platform-grafana` | Syncing | Will auto-sync |
| `*-platform-loki` | Syncing | Will auto-sync |
| `*-platform-prometheus` | Syncing | Will auto-sync |

**Per-environment cert-manager apps removed** (2025-12-05):
- `dev-foundation-cert-manager`, `staging-foundation-cert-manager`, `production-foundation-cert-manager`
- These were orphaned applications with no component file (deleted in commit `92efae5`)
- Per 446, cert-manager should be cluster-scoped only (`cluster-cert-manager` in `cert-manager` namespace)
- Orphaned resources cleaned up from all 3 environment namespaces

### Cluster-Scoped Apps

| App | Reason |
|-----|--------|
| `argocd-cert-manager` | ArgoCD-managed cert-manager |
| `cluster-cert-manager` | Cluster cert-manager operator |

---

## P3 – Progressing Applications

Apps still reconciling (may self-heal once P0 fixed):

- `{env}-data-clickhouse` - ClickHouse installation
- `{env}-data-kafka-cluster` - Kafka cluster startup
- `{env}-data-temporal-namespace-bootstrap` - Temporal namespaces
- `{env}-platform-keycloak` - Keycloak startup
- `{env}-platform-postgres-clusters` - CNPG cluster initialization

---

## Node Topology

| Node Pool | Count | Taint | Capacity |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------|
| system | 2 | `CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoSchedule` | 1.9 CPU, 6GB RAM |
| dev | 1 | `ameide.io/environment=dev:NoSchedule` | 3.8 CPU, 14GB RAM |
| staging | 1 | `ameide.io/environment=staging:NoSchedule` | 3.8 CPU, 14GB RAM |
| prod | 3 | `ameide.io/environment=production:NoSchedule` | 3.8 CPU, 14GB RAM each |

---

## Resolution Priority

1. ~~**Fix Vault tolerations in values**~~ ✅ Already configured correctly
2. ~~**Wait for dev autoscaler**~~ ✅ Second dev node now Ready
3. ~~**Delete outdated vault pods**~~ ✅ Pods recreated, now Running
4. ~~**Fix SecretStore architecture**~~ ✅ Refactored to per-environment SecretStores
5. ~~**Commit and push changes**~~ ✅ Pushed - ArgoCD synced
6. ~~**Vault initializes**~~ ✅ Vault pods running, SecretStores Ready
7. ~~**SecretStores connect**~~ ✅ ExternalSecrets syncing
8. ~~**Secrets available**~~ ✅ Most secrets created (ghcr-pull, minio, etc.)
9. ~~**Delete orphaned per-env cert-manager**~~ ✅ Apps and resources deleted
10. ~~**Fix tolerations overrides**~~ ✅ Removed empty overrides from 11 apps shared values
11. ~~**Apps auto-syncing**~~ ✅ Pods now scheduling on correct nodes
12. ~~**Fix Vault sealed/K8s auth issues**~~ ✅ All environments operational

**Current Status**: ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED** - All environments operational with secrets syncing.

### Tolerations Fix (2025-12-05)

**Root Cause**: Shared values files explicitly set `nodeSelector: {}` and `tolerations: []`,
overriding the globals.yaml inherited values.

**Fix Applied** (`6c805de`):
- Removed explicit empty values from 11 apps shared values files:
  - `agents.yaml`, `agents-runtime.yaml`, `graph.yaml`, `inference.yaml`
  - `inference-gateway.yaml`, `platform.yaml`, `threads.yaml`
  - `workflows.yaml`, `workflows-runtime.yaml`
  - `www-ameide.yaml`, `www-ameide-platform.yaml`
- Deleted orphaned `foundation-cert-manager.yaml` values files
- Now tolerations/nodeSelector inherited from `globals.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  nodeSelector:
    ameide.io/pool: dev  # or staging/prod
  tolerations:
    - key: "ameide.io/environment"
      value: "dev"  # or staging/production
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  ```

**Verification**:
```bash
# New pods now assigned to correct nodes:
kubectl get pods -n ameide-dev -o wide | grep agents
# agents-785f678b6c-pw52f   aks-dev-21365390-vmss000001
```

### Vault Sealed/K8s Auth Fix (2025-12-05)

**Symptoms discovered**:
- Staging: Vault sealed (503 error)
- Production: Vault Kubernetes auth permission denied (403 error)
- SecretStores showed `InvalidProviderConfig` in both environments

**Root Causes**:
1. **Staging**: Vault pod restarted and was not auto-unsealed
2. **Production**: Kubernetes auth configuration needed `disable_iss_validation=true`

**Fixes Applied**:
```bash
# 1. Unseal staging Vault
UNSEAL_KEY=$(kubectl get secret -n ameide-staging vault-auto-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.unseal-key}' | base64 -d)
kubectl exec -n ameide-staging vault-core-staging-0 -- vault operator unseal "$UNSEAL_KEY"

# 2. Reconfigure Kubernetes auth in both environments
for env in staging prod; do
  ROOT_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret -n ameide-$env vault-auto-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.root-token}' | base64 -d)
  kubectl exec -n ameide-$env vault-core-$env-0 -- sh -c "VAULT_TOKEN=$ROOT_TOKEN vault write auth/kubernetes/config kubernetes_host='https://kubernetes.default.svc' disable_iss_validation=true"
done

# 3. Force SecretStore reconciliation
kubectl annotate secretstore ameide-vault -n ameide-staging force-refresh=$(date +%s) --overwrite
kubectl annotate secretstore ameide-vault -n ameide-prod force-refresh=$(date +%s) --overwrite

# 4. Force ExternalSecrets refresh
for ns in ameide-staging ameide-prod; do
  for es in $(kubectl get externalsecret -n $ns -o name); do
    kubectl annotate "$es" -n $ns force-refresh="$(date +%s)" --overwrite
  done
done
```

**Result**:
```
NAMESPACE        NAME           STATUS   READY
ameide-dev       ameide-vault   Valid    True
ameide-prod      ameide-vault   Valid    True
ameide-staging   ameide-vault   Valid    True
```

All 21 ExternalSecrets in each environment now syncing successfully.

See [451-secrets-management.md](451-secrets-management.md) for detailed troubleshooting runbook.

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Check Vault pods
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=vault -A

# Check per-environment SecretStores (after sync)
kubectl get secretstores -A

# Check ExternalSecrets status
kubectl get externalsecrets -A | grep -v "True"

# Check pending pods
kubectl get pods -A --field-selector=status.phase=Pending

# Check CreateContainerConfigError pods
kubectl get pods -A | grep CreateContainerConfigError

## 450-envoy-gateway-per-environment-architecture.md

# 450: Envoy Gateway Per-Environment Architecture

**Status**: Implemented
**Created**: 2025-12-04

## Summary

This document describes the per-environment Envoy Gateway architecture where each environment (dev, staging, production, cluster) has its own GatewayClass, EnvoyProxy, and dedicated static IP. This supersedes the previous shared GatewayClass approach.

## Why Per-Environment GatewayClasses

The previous architecture used a single shared `GatewayClass` named `envoy` for all environments. This caused issues because:

1. **GatewayClass is cluster-scoped** - Only one can exist with a given name
2. **parametersRef limitation** - GatewayClass can only reference ONE EnvoyProxy resource
3. **Race condition** - Whichever environment synced last would overwrite the GatewayClass parametersRef
4. **Wrong IPs assigned** - All environments got the last-synced environment's static IP configuration

The solution is **one GatewayClass per environment**, each referencing its own EnvoyProxy with correct static IP and tolerations.

## Resource Mapping

| Environment | GatewayClass | EnvoyProxy | Gateway Namespace | Static IP | Domain |
|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| Dev | `envoy-dev` | `ameide-dev/ameide-proxy-config` | `ameide-dev` | 40.68.113.216 | `*.dev.ameide.io` |
| Staging | `envoy-staging` | `ameide-staging/ameide-proxy-config` | `ameide-staging` | 108.142.228.7 | `*.staging.ameide.io` |
| Production | `envoy-prod` | `ameide-prod/ameide-proxy-config` | `ameide-prod` | 4.180.130.190 | `*.ameide.io` |
| Cluster (ArgoCD) | `envoy-cluster` | `argocd/cluster-proxy-config` | `argocd` | 20.160.216.7 | `argocd.ameide.io` |

## TLS Termination

TLS is terminated at the Gateway level using wildcard certificates issued by cert-manager.

### Certificate Chain

```
Let's Encrypt (ACME)
       │
       ▼
ClusterIssuer: letsencrypt-prod
       │
       ▼
Certificate: ameide-wildcard-tls (per environment namespace)
       │
       ▼
Secret: ameide-wildcard-tls
       │
       ▼
Gateway listener (tls.mode: Terminate)
       │
       ▼
Plain HTTP to backend services
```

### Gateway TLS Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ameide
  namespace: ameide-dev  # per environment
spec:
  gatewayClassName: envoy-dev  # per environment
  listeners:
    - name: https
      port: 443
      protocol: HTTPS
      hostname: "*.dev.ameide.io"
      tls:
        mode: Terminate
        certificateRefs:
          - name: ameide-wildcard-tls
      allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: Selector
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              gateway-access: allowed
```

### HTTP to HTTPS Redirect

> **Updated 2025-12-05**: HTTP redirect is now handled by an HTTP listener on the main gateway,
> not a separate redirect gateway. See [457-azure-lb-redirect-gateway-consolidation.md](457-azure-lb-redirect-gateway-consolidation.md).

Each environment's main gateway includes an HTTP listener (port 80) for redirect:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ameide
  namespace: ameide-dev
spec:
  gatewayClassName: envoy-dev
  listeners:
    # HTTP listener for HTTP→HTTPS redirect
    - name: http
      port: 80
      protocol: HTTP
      hostname: "*.dev.ameide.io"
      allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: Same
    # HTTPS listener for TLS termination
    - name: https
      port: 443
      protocol: HTTPS
      hostname: "*.dev.ameide.io"
      tls:
        mode: Terminate
        certificateRefs:
          - name: ameide-wildcard-tls
```

An HTTPRoute on the HTTP listener issues the redirect:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: ameide-redirect
  namespace: ameide-dev
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: ameide
      sectionName: http
  rules:
    - filters:
        - type: RequestRedirect
          requestRedirect:
            scheme: https
            statusCode: 301
```

**Why single gateway instead of separate redirect gateway?**

Azure LoadBalancer doesn't reliably support multiple `LoadBalancer` Services sharing the same static IP.
Creating a separate redirect gateway caused Azure to reject the second service with IP conflicts.
The single-gateway pattern follows Gateway API / Envoy Gateway vendor recommendations.

## Observability

### Prometheus Metrics

Each EnvoyProxy enables Prometheus metrics scraping:

```yaml
spec:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      prometheus: {}  # Empty object enables default metrics
```

Metrics are scraped by ServiceMonitors and available in Grafana.

### Access Logs (OpenTelemetry)

Access logs are sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector in each environment namespace:

```yaml
spec:
  telemetry:
    accessLog:
      settings:
        - format:
            type: JSON
            json:
              start_time: "%START_TIME%"
              method: "%REQ(:METHOD)%"
              path: "%REQ(X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH?:PATH)%"
              protocol: "%PROTOCOL%"
              response_code: "%RESPONSE_CODE%"
              duration: "%DURATION%"
              upstream_host: "%UPSTREAM_HOST%"
              # ... additional fields
          sinks:
            - type: OpenTelemetry
              openTelemetry:
                host: otel-collector.ameide-dev.svc.cluster.local
                port: 4317
                resources:
                  k8s.cluster.name: "ameide-dev"
```

## Implementation Files

### Chart Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `sources/charts/apps/gateway/templates/gatewayclass.yaml` | GatewayClass with parametersRef to EnvoyProxy |
| `sources/charts/apps/gateway/templates/envoyproxy-telemetry.yaml` | EnvoyProxy with static IP, tolerations, telemetry |
| `sources/charts/apps/gateway/templates/gateway.yaml` | Main Gateway (HTTP+HTTPS listeners) |
| `sources/charts/apps/gateway/templates/http-redirect.yaml` | HTTP→HTTPS redirect HTTPRoute |

### Per-Environment Values

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `sources/values/dev/platform/platform-gateway.yaml` | `gatewayClass.name: envoy-dev`, `gateway.className: envoy-dev`, static IP, tolerations |
| `sources/values/staging/platform/platform-gateway.yaml` | `gatewayClass.name: envoy-staging`, etc. |
| `sources/values/production/platform/platform-gateway.yaml` | `gatewayClass.name: envoy-prod`, etc. |

### Cluster Gateway (ArgoCD)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `sources/charts/cluster/gateway/templates/gatewayclass.yaml` | `envoy-cluster` GatewayClass |
| `sources/charts/cluster/gateway/templates/envoyproxy.yaml` | ArgoCD EnvoyProxy with `CriticalAddonsOnly` toleration |

## Verification Commands

### Check GatewayClasses

```bash
kubectl get gatewayclass
# Expected: envoy-dev, envoy-staging, envoy-prod, envoy-cluster (all ACCEPTED: True)
```

### Check Gateways

```bash
kubectl get gateway -A
# Expected: One 'ameide' gateway per environment, PROGRAMMED: True with correct IPs
# Note: No separate 'ameide-redirect' gateways (consolidated into main gateway)
```

### Check EnvoyProxy Resources

```bash
kubectl get envoyproxy -A
# Expected: One per environment namespace
```

### Check Envoy Pods

```bash
kubectl get pods -A -l gateway.envoyproxy.io/owning-gateway-name
# Expected: 4 pods (1 per environment), all Running
# Note: Single gateway per environment means single Envoy deployment per environment
```

### Check Services with IPs

```bash
kubectl get svc -A -l gateway.envoyproxy.io/owning-gateway-name \
  -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,IP:.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].ip'
```

### Test TLS

```bash
curl -v https://platform.dev.ameide.io 2>&1 | grep -E 'SSL|TLS|certificate'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway shows PROGRAMMED: False

1. Check EnvoyProxy exists in correct namespace
2. Check GatewayClass parametersRef points to correct namespace
3. Check Envoy pods are Running (may be Pending due to taints)

### Wrong IP assigned

1. Verify EnvoyProxy has correct `loadBalancerIP` in spec
2. Delete the LoadBalancer service to force recreation
3. Check Azure annotations are correct

### Envoy pods Pending

1. Check tolerations match node taints
2. For dev/staging/prod: need `ameide.io/environment` toleration
3. For cluster: need `CriticalAddonsOnly` toleration

### TLS certificate errors

1. Check Certificate resource is Ready: `kubectl get certificate -A`
2. Check Secret exists: `kubectl get secret ameide-wildcard-tls -n <namespace>`
3. Check Gateway references correct secret name

## Migration Notes

### From Shared GatewayClass

If migrating from the old shared `envoy` GatewayClass:

1. The old `envoy` GatewayClass may still exist - it can be deleted once all Gateways use per-environment classes
2. Old Envoy services with wrong IPs should be deleted to force recreation
3. ArgoCD will recreate resources with correct configuration on next sync

### Document Updates Needed

The following documents reference the old architecture and should note this document:

- **386-envoy-gateway-cert-tls-docs.md**: References `envoy-gateway-system` namespace for EnvoyProxy
- **436-envoy-gateway-observability.md**: References shared `envoy` GatewayClass

# 451 – Secrets Management Architecture

**Status**: Implemented
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Related**: [444-terraform.md](444-terraform.md), [449-per-environment-infrastructure.md](449-per-environment-infrastructure.md), [450-argocd-service-issues-inventory.md](450-argocd-service-issues-inventory.md)

## Overview

This document describes the end-to-end secrets flow from developer `.env` files to Kubernetes Secrets in environment namespaces. The architecture uses Azure Key Vault as the external source of truth, HashiCorp Vault as the internal secret store, and ExternalSecrets Operator to sync secrets to Kubernetes.

## Components

### 1. deploy.sh - Secret Parsing

**File**: `infra/scripts/deploy.sh`

The `parse_env_to_tfvars()` function:
1. Reads `.env` and `.env.local` files
2. Sanitizes keys: `GHCR_TOKEN` → `ghcr-token` (lowercase, underscores/dots to dashes)
3. Creates temporary `.tfvars.json` file with `env_secrets` variable
4. Terraform creates `azurerm_key_vault_secret` resources

```bash
# Key sanitization rules (Azure Key Vault requirements):
# - Lowercase only
# - Replace _ with -
# - Replace . with -
sanitized_key="$(echo "${key}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed -e 's/[_.]/-/g')"
```

### 2. Terraform - Key Vault Secrets

**File**: `infra/terraform/azure/main.tf`

```hcl
resource "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "env_secrets" {
  for_each = nonsensitive(toset(keys(var.env_secrets)))

  name         = each.key
  value        = var.env_secrets[each.key]
  key_vault_id = module.keyvault.id
}
```

### 3. Terraform - Vault Bootstrap Identity

**File**: `infra/terraform/azure/main.tf`

Per-environment federated credentials allow vault-bootstrap to authenticate:

```hcl
vault_bootstrap_subjects = {
  dev     = "system:serviceaccount:ameide-dev:foundation-vault-bootstrap-vault-bootstrap"
  staging = "system:serviceaccount:ameide-staging:foundation-vault-bootstrap-vault-bootstrap"
  prod    = "system:serviceaccount:ameide-prod:foundation-vault-bootstrap-vault-bootstrap"
}

module "vault_bootstrap_identity" {
  federated_credentials = {
    for name, subject in local.vault_bootstrap_subjects : "vault-bootstrap-${name}" => {
      issuer  = module.aks.oidc_issuer_url
      subject = subject
    }
  }

  role_assignments = {
    keyvault-secrets-user = {
      scope = module.keyvault.id
      role  = "Key Vault Secrets User"
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. vault-bootstrap CronJob

**File**: `sources/charts/foundation/vault-bootstrap/templates/cronjob.yaml`

The CronJob runs in each environment namespace and:
1. Uses Azure Workload Identity to authenticate to Key Vault
2. Fetches secrets and overwrites fixture defaults
3. Writes to HashiCorp Vault KV store

Key configuration:
```yaml
azure:
  keyVault:
    uri: "https://ameidekv.vault.azure.net/"
    secretPrefix: ""  # No prefix - matches sanitized .env keys
```

### 5. SecretStore (Per-Environment)

**File**: `sources/values/_shared/foundation/foundation-vault-secret-store.yaml`

Each environment has its own SecretStore pointing to local Vault:

```yaml
# ameide-dev
SecretStore/ameide-vault → foundation-vault-core.ameide-dev.svc.cluster.local:8200

# ameide-staging
SecretStore/ameide-vault → foundation-vault-core.ameide-staging.svc.cluster.local:8200

# ameide-prod
SecretStore/ameide-vault → foundation-vault-core.ameide-prod.svc.cluster.local:8200
```

### 6. ExternalSecrets

ExternalSecrets sync from Vault to Kubernetes Secrets. Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: ghcr-pull-sync
  namespace: ameide-dev
spec:
  secretStoreRef:
    kind: SecretStore
    name: ameide-vault
  target:
    name: ghcr-pull
    template:
      type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
  data:

## Secret Key Mapping

| .env Variable | Azure Key Vault | HashiCorp Vault | K8s Secret |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| `GHCR_TOKEN` | `ghcr-token` | `secret/ghcr-token` | `ghcr-pull` |
| `GHCR_USER` | `ghcr-user` | `secret/ghcr-user` | `ghcr-pull` |
| `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` | `langfuse-secret-key` | `secret/langfuse-secret-key` | `langfuse-secrets` |
| `MINIO_ROOT_USER` | `minio-root-user` | `secret/minio-root-user` | `minio-root-credentials` |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Secrets Not Syncing

1. **Check vault-bootstrap logs**:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n ameide-dev -l job-name=foundation-vault-bootstrap-vault-bootstrap-<id>
   ```

2. **Verify Azure Key Vault secrets exist**:
   ```bash
   az keyvault secret list --vault-name ameidekv -o table
   ```

3. **Check federated identity credentials**:
   ```bash
   az identity federated-credential list \
     --identity-name ameide-vault-bootstrap-mi \
     --resource-group Ameide -o table
   ```

4. **Verify Vault has real values** (not placeholders):
   ```bash
   ROOT_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret -n ameide-dev vault-auto-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.root-token}' | base64 -d)
   kubectl exec -n ameide-dev foundation-vault-core-0 -- sh -c "VAULT_TOKEN=$ROOT_TOKEN vault kv get secret/ghcr-token"
   ```

5. **Check ExternalSecret status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get externalsecrets -n ameide-dev
   kubectl describe externalsecret ghcr-pull-sync -n ameide-dev
   ```

### Common Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `ImagePullBackOff` | ghcr-pull secret has placeholder | Check vault-bootstrap federated identity |
| vault-bootstrap fails silently | Missing `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE` | Verify workload identity webhook running |
| SecretStore not Ready | Vault not initialized | Wait for vault-bootstrap to complete |
| ExternalSecret shows `SecretSyncError` | Vault path incorrect | Check `secretPrefix` in values |
| SecretStore `InvalidProviderConfig` | Vault sealed | Unseal Vault (see below) |
| SecretStore `permission denied` (403) | Kubernetes auth not configured | Run vault-bootstrap or reconfigure manually |

### Vault Sealed (503 Error)

If Vault is sealed, the SecretStore shows `InvalidProviderConfig` with error:
```
unable to log in with Kubernetes auth: Error making API request.
Code: 503. Errors: * Vault is sealed
```

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Get unseal key (replace <env> with dev/staging/prod)
UNSEAL_KEY=$(kubectl get secret -n ameide-<env> vault-auto-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.unseal-key}' | base64 -d)

# Unseal vault
kubectl exec -n ameide-<env> vault-core-<env>-0 -- vault operator unseal "$UNSEAL_KEY"

# Verify
kubectl exec -n ameide-<env> vault-core-<env>-0 -- vault status
```

### Kubernetes Auth Permission Denied (403 Error)

If SecretStore shows `InvalidProviderConfig` with error:
```
Code: 403. Errors: * permission denied
```

This indicates Vault's Kubernetes auth is not properly configured.

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Get root token
ROOT_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret -n ameide-<env> vault-auto-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.root-token}' | base64 -d)

# Reconfigure kubernetes auth
kubectl exec -n ameide-<env> vault-core-<env>-0 -- sh -c "VAULT_TOKEN=$ROOT_TOKEN vault write auth/kubernetes/config kubernetes_host='https://kubernetes.default.svc' disable_iss_validation=true"

# Force SecretStore reconciliation
kubectl annotate secretstore ameide-vault -n ameide-<env> force-refresh=$(date +%s) --overwrite
```

### Force ExternalSecrets Refresh

After fixing SecretStore issues, ExternalSecrets may be cached as failed:
```bash
# Refresh all ExternalSecrets in a namespace
for es in $(kubectl get externalsecret -n ameide-<env> -o name); do
  kubectl annotate "$es" -n ameide-<env> force-refresh="$(date +%s)" --overwrite
done
```

## 452-observability-namespace-isolation.md

# 452 – Observability Stack Namespace Isolation

**Status**: Implemented
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Related**: [445-argocd-namespace-isolation.md](445-argocd-namespace-isolation.md), [446-namespace-isolation.md](446-namespace-isolation.md), [447-waves-v3-cluster-scoped-operators.md](447-waves-v3-cluster-scoped-operators.md), [447-third-party-chart-tolerations.md](447-third-party-chart-tolerations.md), [454-coredns-cluster-scoped.md](454-coredns-cluster-scoped.md)

---

## Problem Statement

The observability stack (Loki, Grafana, Prometheus, Alloy, kube-state-metrics) was creating **cluster-scoped RBAC resources** (ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding) with hardcoded names. This caused:

1. **ArgoCD OutOfSync conflicts**: Multiple environments trying to manage the same cluster-scoped resource
2. **Ownership races**: Whichever environment synced last "owned" the shared resource
3. **Violates isolation principle**: Environments should be fully isolated; shared resources belong to cluster scope

### Symptoms

```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd | grep -E "loki|grafana|prometheus|alloy"
# dev-platform-loki         OutOfSync
# dev-platform-grafana      OutOfSync
# production-platform-loki  OutOfSync
# etc.
```

ArgoCD conditions showed:
```
ClusterRole/platform-loki-clusterrole is part of applications argocd/dev-platform-loki and staging-platform-loki
```

---

## Design Principle

> **What belongs to shared goes to cluster, what belongs to environments goes to environments.**

For observability:
- Each environment has its **own** Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Alloy instance
- Each instance should **only** monitor/collect from its own namespace
- No cluster-scoped RBAC needed - use namespace-scoped Roles instead

---

## Solution

Configure all observability components to use **namespace-scoped RBAC** and **namespace-scoped discovery**.

### Component Configuration

| Component | Setting | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Loki** | `rbac.namespaced: true` | Creates Role instead of ClusterRole |
| **Grafana** | `rbac.namespaced: true` | Creates Role instead of ClusterRole |
| **Alloy** | `rbac.namespaces: [ameide-{env}]` | Creates Role only for own namespace |
| **Prometheus** | `*NamespaceSelector.matchLabels` | Only discovers monitors in own namespace |
| **kube-state-metrics** | `namespaces: "ameide-{env}"` | Only collects metrics from own namespace |

### Trade-offs

With full namespace isolation:
- ❌ kube-state-metrics cannot see cluster-scoped resources (nodes, PVs, storageclasses)
- ❌ Alloy cannot collect logs from other namespaces
- ❌ Prometheus cannot scrape metrics from other namespaces
- ✅ Full environment isolation achieved
- ✅ No ArgoCD ownership conflicts
- ✅ Each environment is self-contained

---

---

## Post-Sync Cleanup

After ArgoCD syncs, the following **orphaned cluster-scoped resources** should be deleted:

```bash
# ClusterRoles (replaced by namespace-scoped Roles)
kubectl delete clusterrole platform-loki-clusterrole
kubectl delete clusterrole platform-grafana-clusterrole
kubectl delete clusterrole alloy-logs
kubectl delete clusterrole platform-prometheus-kube-state-metrics

# ClusterRoleBindings
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding platform-loki-clusterrolebinding
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding platform-grafana-clusterrolebinding
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding alloy-logs
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding platform-prometheus-kube-state-metrics
```

---

## Verification

### Check no cluster-scoped RBAC for observability

```bash
# Should return empty after cleanup
kubectl get clusterrole | grep -E "loki|grafana|alloy|kube-state-metrics"
kubectl get clusterrolebinding | grep -E "loki|grafana|alloy|kube-state-metrics"
```

### Check namespace-scoped Roles created

```bash
# Should show Roles in each environment namespace
kubectl get role -n ameide-dev | grep -E "loki|grafana|alloy"
kubectl get role -n ameide-staging | grep -E "loki|grafana|alloy"
kubectl get role -n ameide-prod | grep -E "loki|grafana|alloy"
```

### Check ArgoCD apps are Synced

```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd | grep -E "loki|grafana|prometheus|alloy"
# All should show Synced/Healthy
```

---

## Chart Value Paths Reference

For future reference when adding new observability components:

| Chart | Namespace RBAC Setting |
|-------|----------------------|
| grafana/loki | `rbac.namespaced: true` |
| grafana/grafana | `rbac.namespaced: true` |
| grafana/alloy | `rbac.namespaces: [<namespace>]` |
| prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack | `prometheus.prometheusSpec.*NamespaceSelector` |
| prometheus-community/kube-state-metrics | `namespaces: "<namespace>"` |

---

## Prometheus Operator Architecture

The kube-prometheus-stack chart bundles several components with different scope requirements:

| Component | Scope | Deployed By | Status |
|-----------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Prometheus CRDs | cluster | `cluster-crds-prometheus` | ✅ Done |
| Prometheus Operator | cluster | `cluster-prometheus-operator` | ✅ Done |
| Prometheus Server | per-env | `{env}-platform-prometheus` | ✅ Done |
| Alertmanager | per-env | `{env}-platform-prometheus` | ✅ Done |
| kube-state-metrics | per-env | `{env}-platform-prometheus` | ✅ Done |
| Grafana | per-env | `{env}-platform-grafana` | ✅ Done |

### Implementation

The Prometheus Operator is deployed at cluster scope via:
- **Component**: `environments/_shared/components/cluster/operators/prometheus-operator/component.yaml`
- **Values**: `sources/values/_shared/cluster/prometheus-operator.yaml`
- **Namespace**: `prometheus-system`

Per-environment deployments disable the operator:
```yaml
# sources/values/_shared/observability/platform-prometheus.yaml
prometheusOperator:
  enabled: false
```

---

## Operator Pattern for Third-Party Charts

**This is the expected approach for ANY operator from third-party Helm charts.**

### When to Use Cluster Scope

Deploy to cluster scope if the component:
1. Creates **ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding** with hardcoded names
2. Creates **MutatingWebhookConfiguration/ValidatingWebhookConfiguration**
3. Creates **CRDs** (always cluster-scoped)
4. Manages resources across **ALL namespaces**

### How to Implement

1. **Create cluster component**: `environments/_shared/components/cluster/operators/<name>/component.yaml`
2. **Create cluster values**: `sources/values/_shared/cluster/<name>.yaml`
3. **Disable in per-env**: Set `<operator>.enabled: false` in shared values
4. **Deploy to dedicated namespace**: e.g., `<name>-system`

### Example: Splitting a Bundled Chart

Many charts bundle operators with workloads (like kube-prometheus-stack). Split them:

```
Chart: kube-prometheus-stack
├── cluster-prometheus-operator (cluster scope)
│   └── prometheusOperator.enabled: true
│   └── prometheus.enabled: false
│   └── alertmanager.enabled: false
│
└── {env}-platform-prometheus (per-env)
    └── prometheusOperator.enabled: false
    └── prometheus.enabled: true
    └── alertmanager.enabled: true
```

### Existing Cluster-Scoped Operators

| Operator | Namespace | Watches |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| cloudnative-pg | cnpg-system | All namespaces for Cluster CRs |
| strimzi | strimzi-system | All namespaces for Kafka CRs |
| external-secrets | external-secrets-system | All namespaces for ExternalSecret CRs |
| keycloak | keycloak-system | All namespaces for Keycloak CRs |
| clickhouse | clickhouse-system | All namespaces for ClickHouseInstallation CRs |
| redis | redis-system | All namespaces for RedisFailover CRs |
| prometheus-operator | prometheus-system | All namespaces for Prometheus/ServiceMonitor CRs |

## 452-vault-rbac-isolation.md

# 452: Vault RBAC Isolation

## Status: Implemented

## Problem

HashiCorp Vault's agent-injector creates cluster-scoped resources (ClusterRoleBinding, MutatingWebhookConfiguration) that conflict when multiple Vault instances are deployed across environments. Similar to cert-manager (see [448](448-cert-manager-workload-identity.md)), the "last sync wins" behavior causes:

1. **ClusterRoleBindings only reference one namespace** - staging/prod vault-agent-injector pods lose RBAC permissions
2. **MutatingWebhookConfiguration points to wrong service** - pod injection fails in other environments

**Symptoms:**
- `vault-agent-injector-binding` only references the last-synced environment's ServiceAccount
- `vault-agent-injector-cfg` webhook points to one namespace's service
- Pod injection silently fails in environments that weren't synced last

## Solution

Apply per-environment naming via `fullnameOverride` to create unique cluster-scoped resources:

| Environment | fullnameOverride | ClusterRoleBinding | MutatingWebhookConfig |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| dev | `vault-core-dev` | `vault-core-dev-agent-injector-binding-ameide-dev` | `vault-core-dev-agent-injector-cfg` |
| staging | `vault-core-staging` | `vault-core-staging-agent-injector-binding-ameide-staging` | `vault-core-staging-agent-injector-cfg` |
| production | `vault-core-prod` | `vault-core-prod-agent-injector-binding-ameide-prod` | `vault-core-prod-agent-injector-cfg` |

```

## Implementation Details

### Per-Environment Values Files

**`sources/values/{env}/foundation/foundation-vault-core.yaml`:**
```yaml
# Per-environment naming for complete RBAC isolation
fullnameOverride: vault-core-{env}  # vault-core-dev, vault-core-staging, vault-core-prod

injector:
  # Per-environment TLS certificate from vault-webhook-certs
  certs:
    secretName: vault-core-{env}-injector-tls
  webhook:
    annotations:
      cert-manager.io/inject-ca-from: ameide-{env}/vault-core-{env}-injector-tls
```

### Dynamic Service References

Components that reference Vault's service must derive the name from the namespace:

**SecretStore** (`sources/values/_shared/foundation/foundation-vault-secret-store.yaml`):
```yaml
{{- $envSuffix := trimPrefix "ameide-" .Release.Namespace }}
server: "http://vault-core-{{ $envSuffix }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:8200"
```

**vault-bootstrap CronJob** (`sources/charts/foundation/vault-bootstrap/templates/cronjob.yaml`):
```yaml
{{- $envSuffix := trimPrefix "ameide-" .Release.Namespace }}
- name: VAULT_ADDR
  value: "http://vault-core-{{ $envSuffix }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:8200"
```

### TLS Certificate Configuration

Each environment needs its own TLS certificate for the agent-injector webhook:

**`sources/values/{env}/foundation/foundation-vault-webhook-certs.yaml`:**
```yaml
servingCertificate:
  name: vault-core-{env}-injector-tls
  secretName: vault-core-{env}-injector-tls
  commonName: vault-core-{env}-agent-injector-svc.ameide-{env}.svc
  dnsNames:
    - vault-core-{env}-agent-injector-svc
    - vault-core-{env}-agent-injector-svc.ameide-{env}.svc
    - vault-core-{env}-agent-injector-svc.ameide-{env}.svc.cluster.local
```

## Verification

```bash
# Check per-environment ClusterRoleBindings
kubectl get clusterrolebinding -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,SA:.subjects[*].name,NS:.subjects[*].namespace' | grep vault-core

# Check per-environment MutatingWebhookConfigurations
kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration | grep vault-core

# Verify each webhook points to correct namespace service
for env in dev staging prod; do
  kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration vault-core-$env-agent-injector-cfg \
    -o jsonpath='{.webhooks[0].clientConfig.service.namespace}/{.webhooks[0].clientConfig.service.name}'
  echo
done

# Verify vault status in each environment
for ns in ameide-dev ameide-staging ameide-prod; do
  env="${ns#ameide-}"
  kubectl exec -n $ns vault-core-$env-0 -- vault status | grep -E "Initialized|Sealed"
done

# Verify SecretStores are valid
kubectl get secretstores -A -o wide
```

## Migration Notes

**WARNING:** Changing `fullnameOverride` creates a NEW StatefulSet with a new PVC. This is a **disruptive change** that:
1. Creates new vault pods with new persistent storage
2. Requires vault re-initialization
3. Loses existing vault data unless migrated

For production migrations:
1. Backup vault data before applying changes
2. Export secrets from old vault
3. Apply changes and wait for new vault to initialize
4. Re-import secrets or run vault-bootstrap to sync from Azure Key Vault

# 454 – CoreDNS Config Cluster-Scoped Migration

**Status**: Implemented
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Related**: [446-namespace-isolation.md](446-namespace-isolation.md), [447-waves-v3-cluster-scoped-operators.md](447-waves-v3-cluster-scoped-operators.md), [452-observability-namespace-isolation.md](452-observability-namespace-isolation.md)

## Why CoreDNS Config is Cluster-Scoped (Not Per-Environment)

### Vendor Documentation

AKS docs explicitly state:
- CoreDNS is a **managed cluster add-on** for cluster-wide DNS resolution
- Customizations are done via a **single `coredns-custom` ConfigMap in `kube-system`**
- You **cannot** have multiple CoreDNS instances or configs per namespace

Reference: [Microsoft Learn - Customize CoreDNS for AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/coredns-custom)

### ArgoCD Best Practices

ArgoCD maintainers are clear:
- `SharedResourceWarning` appears when multiple apps manage the same resource - this is a **misconfiguration**
- Best practice: **a given Kubernetes resource must be owned by exactly one ArgoCD Application**

Reference: [ArgoCD Resource Tracking](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/resource_tracking/)

### Scope Clarification

The principle "cluster scoped only the operators; envs own their services/configmaps" is correct, but CoreDNS is an edge case:

| Scope | What It Contains |
|-------|------------------|
| **Cluster** | Operators, CRDs, and **cluster-level system configs** (CoreDNS, etc.) |
| **Environment** | Namespaces, services, deployments, secrets & configmaps **belonging to a specific environment** |

CoreDNS is a **cluster-level system component** (like other operators/add-ons). Its configuration (`coredns-custom` in `kube-system`) is therefore also cluster-level, even though it is technically a ConfigMap.

**Environment apps still own their Envoy services** (`envoy.ameide-dev`, `envoy.ameide-staging`, `envoy.ameide-prod`). The cluster app only manages the DNS rewrites that point to those services.

---

## Problem Statement

The `coredns-custom` ConfigMap in `kube-system` was being managed by **three separate ArgoCD applications** (one per environment):

- `dev-foundation-coredns-config`
- `staging-foundation-coredns-config`
- `production-foundation-coredns-config`

This caused:
1. **ArgoCD OutOfSync conflicts**: All three apps tried to manage the same ConfigMap
2. **Ownership races**: Whichever environment synced last "owned" the ConfigMap
3. **Incomplete DNS rewrites**: Only one environment's rewrites were active at a time

### Symptoms

```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd | grep coredns
# dev-foundation-coredns-config         OutOfSync     Healthy
# staging-foundation-coredns-config     Synced        Healthy
# production-foundation-coredns-config  OutOfSync     Healthy
```

ArgoCD conditions showed:
```
SharedResourceWarning: ConfigMap/coredns-custom is part of applications
argocd/production-foundation-coredns-config and dev-foundation-coredns-config
```

---

## Design Principle

> **What belongs to shared goes to cluster, what belongs to environments goes to environments.**

The `coredns-custom` ConfigMap is a **cluster-scoped resource** (in `kube-system`) that affects DNS resolution for ALL environments. It belongs to cluster scope.

---

## Solution

Consolidate into a **single cluster-scoped application** that manages all environment rewrites:

### Component Location

```
environments/_shared/components/cluster/configs/coredns-config/component.yaml
```

### Values File

```yaml
# sources/values/cluster/coredns-config.yaml
manifests:
  - |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: coredns-custom
      namespace: kube-system
    data:
      ameide.override: |
        # Development environment
        rewrite name regex (.+\.)?dev\.ameide\.io envoy.ameide-dev.svc.cluster.local
        rewrite name regex (.+\.)?tilt\.ameide\.io envoy.ameide-dev.svc.cluster.local
        # Staging environment
        rewrite name regex (.+\.)?staging\.ameide\.io envoy.ameide-staging.svc.cluster.local
        # Production environment (must be last)
        rewrite name regex (.+\.)?ameide\.io envoy.ameide-prod.svc.cluster.local
```

### Rollout Phase

Phase **030** (post-operator config) in the cluster ApplicationSet.

---

## Files Changed

| Action | Path |
|--------|------|
| Created | `environments/_shared/components/cluster/configs/coredns-config/component.yaml` |
| Created | `sources/values/cluster/coredns-config.yaml` |
| Deleted | `environments/_shared/components/foundation/coredns-config/` |

---

## Post-Sync Cleanup

After ArgoCD syncs, the old per-environment applications will be deleted automatically by the ApplicationSet controller. The orphaned tracking annotations on the ConfigMap will be replaced.

---

## Verification

### Check single cluster-scoped app

```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd | grep coredns
# cluster-coredns-config    Synced    Healthy
```

### Check ConfigMap has all rewrites

```bash
kubectl get configmap coredns-custom -n kube-system -o yaml
# Should show all three environment rewrites
```

### Check DNS resolution works

```bash
# From a pod in the cluster
nslookup dev.ameide.io
# Should resolve to envoy.ameide-dev.svc.cluster.local

nslookup staging.ameide.io
# Should resolve to envoy.ameide-staging.svc.cluster.local

nslookup ameide.io
# Should resolve to envoy.ameide-prod.svc.cluster.local
```

---

## Rewrite Order

The order of rewrites matters because CoreDNS processes them top-to-bottom:

1. `*.dev.ameide.io` → dev envoy (most specific subdomain first)
2. `*.tilt.ameide.io` → dev envoy (development tooling)
3. `*.staging.ameide.io` → staging envoy
4. `*.ameide.io` → production envoy (catch-all, must be last)

---

## Related Changes

This completes the namespace isolation effort:

- **445**: ArgoCD namespace isolation
- **446**: Environment namespace isolation (`ameide-dev`, `ameide-staging`, `ameide-prod`)
- **447**: Dual ApplicationSet model (cluster vs environment scope)
- **447**: Third-party chart tolerations
- **448**: Cert-manager workload identity
- **452**: Observability namespace isolation
- **454**: CoreDNS cluster-scoped migration (this document)

## 455-traffic-manager-ignoredifferences.md

# 455: Traffic-Manager ignoreDifferences Namespace Templating

**Status**: Implemented
**Related**: [446-namespace-isolation.md](446-namespace-isolation.md), [447-waves-v3-cluster-scoped-operators.md](447-waves-v3-cluster-scoped-operators.md)

## Problem Statement

Traffic-manager (Telepresence) creates MutatingWebhookConfigurations with names that include the namespace:
- `agent-injector-webhook-ameide-dev`
- `agent-injector-webhook-ameide-staging`
- `agent-injector-webhook-ameide-prod`

These webhooks are modified at runtime by:
1. **Traffic-manager itself** - generates `caBundle` dynamically at startup
2. **AKS Admission Enforcer** - injects `namespaceSelector` and `objectSelector`

The original `ignoreDifferences` configuration used a static name (`agent-injector-webhook-ameide`) which didn't match any actual resource, causing perpetual OutOfSync status.

## Solution

### 1. Namespace Templating in ignoreDifferences

Component files can now use `{{ .namespace }}` in ignoreDifferences name fields:

```yaml
# environments/_shared/components/platform/control-plane/telepresence/component.yaml
ignoreDifferences:
  - group: admissionregistration.k8s.io
    kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
    name: agent-injector-webhook-{{ .namespace }}
    jsonPointers:
      - /webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle
      - /webhooks/0/namespaceSelector
      - /webhooks/0/objectSelector
```

### 2. ApplicationSet templatePatch Enhancement

The `ameide` ApplicationSet templatePatch now processes ignoreDifferences to resolve namespace placeholders:

```yaml
# argocd/applicationsets/ameide.yaml (templatePatch section)
{{- if hasKey . "ignoreDifferences" }}
ignoreDifferences:
  {{- range .ignoreDifferences }}
  - {{- if hasKey . "group" }}
    group: {{ .group }}
    {{- end }}
    kind: {{ .kind }}
    {{- if hasKey . "name" }}
    {{- $resolvedName := replace "{{ .namespace }}" $ns .name }}
    name: {{ $resolvedName }}
    {{- end }}
    {{- if hasKey . "jsonPointers" }}
    jsonPointers:
      {{- toYaml .jsonPointers | nindent 12 }}
    {{- end }}
    {{- if hasKey . "jqPathExpressions" }}
    jqPathExpressions:
      {{- toYaml .jqPathExpressions | nindent 12 }}
    {{- end }}
    {{- if hasKey . "managedFieldsManagers" }}
    managedFieldsManagers:
      {{- toYaml .managedFieldsManagers | nindent 12 }}
    {{- end }}
  {{- end }}
{{- end }}
```

Key implementation details:
- Uses `replace "{{ .namespace }}" $ns .name` to substitute the placeholder
- Uses `hasKey` checks for all optional fields to avoid template errors
- Supports all ignoreDifferences fields: `group`, `kind`, `name`, `jsonPointers`, `jqPathExpressions`, `managedFieldsManagers`

## Architecture Alignment

This implementation follows the dual ApplicationSet model from [446-namespace-isolation.md](446-namespace-isolation.md):

- **Traffic-manager is environment-scoped**: Deployed per-environment via the `ameide` ApplicationSet
- **Webhook names are namespace-specific**: Each environment gets its own webhook
- **Template resolution happens in ApplicationSet**: The `$ns` variable comes from the matrix generator

## Ignored Fields

The following fields are ignored for traffic-manager MutatingWebhookConfigurations:

| Field | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| `/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle` | Generated dynamically by traffic-manager at startup |
| `/webhooks/0/namespaceSelector` | Injected by AKS Admission Enforcer |
| `/webhooks/0/objectSelector` | Injected by AKS Admission Enforcer |

Additionally, the `mutator-webhook-tls` Secret has TLS certificate fields ignored:
- `/data/ca.crt`
- `/data/tls.crt`
- `/data/tls.key`

## Operational Notes

### Applying Changes to ApplicationSet

The ApplicationSet templatePatch is embedded in the ApplicationSet resource itself. Changes to `argocd/applicationsets/ameide.yaml` require:

```bash
# Force replace to update templatePatch
kubectl replace -f argocd/applicationsets/ameide.yaml --force
```

A simple `kubectl apply` may not update the templatePatch due to strategic merge behavior.

### Verification

After changes, verify the ignoreDifferences resolved correctly:

```bash
# Check resolved name (should show actual namespace, not template)
kubectl get app dev-traffic-manager -n argocd -o jsonpath='{.spec.ignoreDifferences[0].name}'
# Expected: agent-injector-webhook-ameide-dev

# Check sync status
kubectl get app -n argocd | grep traffic
# Expected: Synced / Healthy for all environments
```

## Other Components Using This Pattern

Components that may benefit from namespace templating in ignoreDifferences:
- Any component creating cluster-scoped resources with namespace-specific names
- Webhook configurations that include namespace in their name
- Resources modified by namespace-specific controllers

## 456-ghcr-mirror.md

# GHCR Image Mirroring for Docker Hub Rate Limiting

**Status**: Implemented
**Date**: 2025-12-05
**Related**: [447-waves-v3-cluster-scoped-operators.md](447-waves-v3-cluster-scoped-operators.md)

## Problem Statement

Docker Hub rate limiting caused widespread `ImagePullBackOff` errors across all environments:

```
Failed to pull image "docker.io/library/busybox:1.36.1": 429 Too Many Requests
Server message: toomanyrequests: You have reached your unauthenticated pull rate limit
```

**Rate limits:**
- Anonymous: 100 pulls/6 hours (per IP)
- Authenticated: 200 pulls/6 hours (per user)
- Paid: Unlimited

The AKS cluster shares a NAT IP, so all unauthenticated pulls count against the same limit.

## Solution: GHCR Mirroring

Mirror all third-party Docker Hub images to GitHub Container Registry under `ghcr.io/ameideio/mirror/`.

**Benefits:**
- No rate limiting from GHCR
- Images hosted in same region as GitHub (faster pulls)
- Full control over image availability
- Weekly automated refresh keeps images current

## Infrastructure

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/mirror-images.yaml`

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      dry_run:
        description: 'Dry run (just check, no push)'
        default: 'false'
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 0'  # Weekly Sunday 2am UTC
```

**Required Secrets:**
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` - Docker Hub account
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` - Docker Hub access token
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Auto-provided, needs `packages: write`

### Local Mirroring Script

**File:** `infra/scripts/mirror-images-to-ghcr.sh`

For manual/local mirroring. Requires:
```bash
docker login ghcr.io  # with write access
docker login docker.io  # optional, for higher rate limits
```

## imagePullSecrets Configuration

All namespaces have a `ghcr-pull` secret containing GHCR credentials. Charts must reference this secret to pull from the private GHCR mirror.

### Chart-Specific Patterns

Different Helm charts expect `imagePullSecrets` in different formats:

```yaml
# Standard pattern (most charts)
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: ghcr-pull

# Global pattern (Grafana, ArgoCD)
global:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: ghcr-pull

# Tempo pattern (list of strings, not objects)
tempo:
  pullSecrets:
    - ghcr-pull

# Langfuse pattern (nested under image)
langfuse:
  image:
    pullSecrets:
      - name: ghcr-pull

# Redis Failover CRD pattern (per component)
redis:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: ghcr-pull
sentinel:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: ghcr-pull

# Alloy pattern (under global.image)
global:
  image:
    pullSecrets:
      - name: ghcr-pull

# Loki pattern (root level + sidecar)
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: ghcr-pull
loki:
  image:
    registry: ghcr.io
    repository: ameideio/mirror/loki
sidecar:
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/ameideio/mirror/k8s-sidecar
```

| `sources/charts/platform-layers/plausible/templates/deployment.yaml` | Added `{{- with .Values.imagePullSecrets }}` block |

## Maintenance

### Adding New Images

1. Add to `.github/workflows/mirror-images.yaml` matrix:
   ```yaml
   - source: vendor/image:tag
     target: image:tag
   ```

2. Add to `infra/scripts/mirror-images-to-ghcr.sh`:
   ```bash
   ["vendor/image:tag"]="image:tag"
   ```

3. Run workflow manually or wait for weekly run

4. Update values file to use GHCR path:
   ```yaml
   image:
     repository: ghcr.io/ameideio/mirror/image
     tag: "tag"
   imagePullSecrets:
     - name: ghcr-pull
   ```

### Updating Image Versions

1. Update both mirroring files with new tag
2. Run workflow
3. Update values files with new tag

### Troubleshooting

**401 Unauthorized from GHCR:**
- Verify `ghcr-pull` secret exists in namespace
- Check imagePullSecrets is configured correctly for the chart
- GHCR packages may be "internal" (private) - credentials required

**ImagePullBackOff:**
- Check if image exists in GHCR: `gh api /orgs/ameideio/packages/container/mirror%2F<image>/versions`
- Verify image tag matches exactly
- Check pod events: `kubectl describe pod <name>`

**Workflow failures:**
- Verify DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/TOKEN secrets are set
- Check for Docker Hub rate limiting during pull phase
- Review workflow logs in GitHub Actions

## Related Incidents

- **2025-12-05 Temporal Recovery**: During GHCR mirror alignment, Temporal pods were stuck due to:
  1. Busybox init container (`cgr.dev/chainguard/busybox`) missing `nc` command - fixed by switching to GHCR mirror
  2. Migration job using Docker Hub image (rate limited) - fixed by adding GHCR mirror for `temporalio-admin-tools`

## 457-azure-lb-redirect-gateway-consolidation.md

# 457: Azure LoadBalancer Redirect Gateway Consolidation

**Status**: Implemented
**Created**: 2025-12-05

## Summary

This document describes the consolidation of HTTP→HTTPS redirect functionality from a separate redirect gateway into the main gateway's HTTP listener. This change was necessary to avoid Azure LoadBalancer static IP conflicts.

## Related Documents

| Backlog | Topic | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| [450-envoy-gateway-per-environment-architecture.md](450-envoy-gateway-per-environment-architecture.md) | Per-environment gateway architecture | Updated |
| [441-networking.md](441-networking.md) | Networking improvements | Current |
| [446-namespace-isolation.md](446-namespace-isolation.md) | Namespace isolation | Current |

## Problem Statement

Each environment had two Gateway resources:
- `ameide` - Main gateway (HTTPS on port 443)
- `ameide-redirect` - Redirect gateway (HTTP on port 80)

Both gateways were configured to use the same static Azure public IP (e.g., `40.68.113.216` for dev). When Envoy Gateway created LoadBalancer services for these gateways, Azure rejected the second service with:

```
Error syncing load balancer: failed to ensure load balancer: checkLoadBalancerResourcesConflicts:
service port http-80 is trying to consume the port 80 which is being referenced by an existing
loadBalancing rule ad11465f47fec4f97a90294850276c2b-TCP-80 with the same protocol Tcp and
frontend IP config
```

### Root Cause

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cloud provider doesn't reliably support multiple `LoadBalancer` type Services sharing the same static public IP address. While Azure Load Balancer *can* technically support multiple rules on the same frontend IP with different ports, the AKS implementation has sharp edges:

- Each Service creates its own frontend IP configuration
- Azure detects this as a conflict when ports overlap or when the same IP is reused
- Known issue documented in [Azure/AKS#1621](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/1621)

### Why Production Worked Initially

Production's redirect gateway initially got an IP because both services were created simultaneously during the first sync. The Azure LB was able to configure both rules in a single reconciliation. However, when services were deleted and recreated at different times (as happened during dev gateway debugging), the conflict surfaced.

## Solution

Follow the Gateway API and Envoy Gateway vendor-recommended pattern: **single Gateway with multiple listeners** for HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443).

### Before (Two Gateways)

```yaml
# Main gateway
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ameide
spec:
  gatewayClassName: envoy-dev
  listeners:
    - name: https
      port: 443
      protocol: HTTPS
---
# Redirect gateway (PROBLEMATIC)
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ameide-redirect
spec:
  gatewayClassName: envoy-dev  # Same class = same EnvoyProxy = same static IP
  listeners:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      protocol: HTTP
```

### After (Single Gateway with HTTP Listener)

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ameide
spec:
  gatewayClassName: envoy-dev
  listeners:
    - name: http       # HTTP listener for redirect
      port: 80
      protocol: HTTP
      hostname: "*.dev.ameide.io"
      allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: Same
    - name: https
      port: 443
      protocol: HTTPS
      hostname: "*.dev.ameide.io"
      tls:
        mode: Terminate
        certificateRefs:
          - name: ameide-wildcard-tls
```

This creates a single LoadBalancer service with both ports:
```
80:30585/TCP,443:31824/TCP,8000:32431/TCP,9000:32500/TCP
```

## Implementation

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `sources/charts/apps/gateway/templates/http-redirect.yaml` | Added logic to detect HTTP listener on main gateway and point redirect HTTPRoute accordingly |
| `sources/values/dev/platform/platform-gateway.yaml` | `redirectGateway.enabled: false`, added HTTP listener to `gateway.listeners` |
| `sources/values/staging/platform/platform-gateway.yaml` | Same changes |
| `sources/values/production/platform/platform-gateway.yaml` | Same changes |

### Template Logic

The `http-redirect.yaml` template now supports both patterns:

```yaml
{{- /* Check if redirect gateway is enabled OR if main gateway has an HTTP listener */ -}}
{{- $hasHttpListener := false }}
{{- range .Values.gateway.listeners }}
  {{- if and (eq (.protocol | default "HTTP") "HTTP") (eq (.port | default 80 | int) 80) }}
    {{- $hasHttpListener = true }}
  {{- end }}
{{- end }}
{{- if or .Values.redirectGateway.enabled $hasHttpListener }}
# HTTPRoute points to appropriate gateway
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      {{- if .Values.redirectGateway.enabled }}
      name: {{ .Values.redirectGateway.name }}
      sectionName: {{ .Values.redirectGateway.listener.name | default "http" }}
      {{- else }}
      name: {{ .Values.gateway.name }}
      sectionName: http
      {{- end }}
{{- end }}
```

### Values Configuration Pattern

```yaml
# Disable separate redirect gateway
redirectGateway:
  enabled: false

# Add HTTP listener to main gateway
gateway:
  className: envoy-dev
  listeners:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      protocol: HTTP
      hostname: "*.dev.ameide.io"
      allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: Same
    - name: https
      port: 443
      # ... rest of HTTPS config
```

## Vendor Documentation Alignment

This solution aligns with official vendor guidance:

- **Gateway API**: [HTTP Redirects and Rewrites](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/http-redirect-rewrite/) shows single Gateway with both HTTP and HTTPS listeners
- **Envoy Gateway**: [HTTP Redirects](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/docs/tasks/traffic/http-redirect/) uses the same single-gateway pattern
- **Microsoft Azure**: [AKS#1621](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/1621) confirms static IP reuse issues

## Verification

```bash
# Check single gateway per environment
kubectl get gateway -A
# Expected: One 'ameide' gateway per environment, no 'ameide-redirect'

# Check LoadBalancer service has both ports
kubectl get svc -n argocd -l gateway.envoyproxy.io/owning-gateway-name=ameide
# Expected: Single service with 80, 443, 8000, 9000 ports

# Check gateway is programmed with IP
kubectl get gateway ameide -n ameide-dev -o wide
# Expected: PROGRAMMED=True, ADDRESS=40.68.113.216

# Test HTTP redirect

## Summary

Implement GitHub Actions workflow to validate Helm charts before merge. Currently, chart issues (wrong value paths, missing tolerations, template errors) are only discovered after ArgoCD sync fails in the cluster.

**Status**: ✅ Implemented

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State

- **137 Helm charts** in `sources/charts/` (apps, foundation, platform-layers, third_party)
- **No pre-merge validation** - errors discovered only at runtime
- **Complex value composition** - charts use layered values from `_shared/`, `dev/`, `staging/`, `production/`
- **Third-party charts** have non-obvious value paths (documented in [447](447-third-party-chart-tolerations.md))

### Recent Issues Caused by Missing CI

| Issue | Root Cause | Detection |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Langfuse ImagePullBackOff | Wrong YAML path (`langfuse.image` vs `langfuse.web.image`) | Runtime pod failure |
| Prometheus node-exporter conflicts | Template worked but config was wrong | Runtime port conflicts |
| Missing tolerations | Values existed but at wrong path | Runtime Pending pods |

### Why This Matters

1. **Fast feedback** - Catch errors in PR, not after merge
2. **Prevent outages** - Bad configs don't reach ArgoCD
3. **Developer confidence** - Know your changes work before merge
4. **Documentation** - CI failures explain correct value paths

---

## Solution Design

### Workflow: `helm-test.yaml`

```yaml
name: Helm Chart Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'sources/charts/**'
      - 'sources/values/**'
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'sources/charts/**'
      - 'sources/values/**'

jobs:
  lint:
    # helm lint on all charts

  template:
    # helm template with real values

  kubeconform:
    # Validate generated manifests against K8s schemas
```

### Test Levels

#### Level 1: Helm Lint (Fast, All Charts)

```bash
# Lint all custom charts
find sources/charts/{apps,foundation,platform-layers,data,cluster} \
  -name Chart.yaml -execdir helm lint . \;
```

**Catches**: YAML syntax, missing required values, Chart.yaml issues

#### Level 2: Helm Unit Tests (helm-unittest)

```bash
# Run unit tests for charts with tests/ directory
helm unittest sources/charts/apps/inference-gateway
```

**Catches**: Template logic errors, conditional rendering issues, incorrect values

**Charts with unit tests**: 14 charts including `agents`, `agents-runtime`, `gateway`, `inference`, `inference-gateway`, `platform`, `workflows`, `workflows-runtime`, `helm-test-jobs`, `postgres_clusters`, `vault-bootstrap`, `vault-webhook-certs`, `db-migrations`, `pgadmin`

#### Level 3: Helm Template (Per Environment)

```bash
# Template with composed values (mimics ArgoCD)
helm template www-ameide sources/charts/apps/www-ameide \
  -f sources/values/_shared/apps/www-ameide.yaml \
  -f sources/values/dev/apps/www-ameide.yaml \
  -f sources/values/dev/globals.yaml
```

**Catches**: Template rendering errors, value path mismatches, missing required values

#### Level 4: Kubeconform (Schema Validation)

```bash
# Validate against K8s API schemas
helm template ... | kubeconform -strict -kubernetes-version 1.30.0
```

**Catches**: Invalid K8s resource specs, deprecated API versions, missing required fields

---

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Validation

1. **helm-test.yaml workflow**
   - Trigger on PR + push to main
   - Path filters for `sources/charts/**` and `sources/values/**`
   - Matrix over environments (dev, staging, production)

2. **Chart discovery script**
   - Find all custom charts (exclude `third_party/` for lint)
   - Map charts to their values files

3. **Template test matrix**
   - For each chart × environment combination
   - Compose values in correct order (shared → env-specific → globals)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Validation

1. **Kubeconform integration**
   - Validate against K8s 1.30 schemas
   - Custom CRD schemas for Strimzi, CNPG, etc.

2. **Policy checks (optional)**
   - Required labels present
   - Resource limits defined
   - Tolerations for tainted pools

### Phase 3: Third-Party Charts

1. **Template-only validation** (no lint - they have their own CI)
2. **Values path validation** - ensure our values match chart's schema

---

## Chart → Values Mapping

### Custom Charts

| Chart Path | Shared Values | Env Values |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| `apps/www-ameide` | `_shared/apps/www-ameide.yaml` | `{env}/apps/www-ameide.yaml` |
| `apps/inference` | `_shared/apps/inference.yaml` | `{env}/apps/inference.yaml` |
| `platform-layers/langfuse-bootstrap` | `_shared/platform/langfuse-bootstrap.yaml` | `{env}/platform/platform-langfuse-bootstrap.yaml` |
| `foundation/vault-bootstrap` | `_shared/foundation/foundation-vault-bootstrap.yaml` | - |

### Third-Party Charts (Template Only)

| Chart | Values Prefix | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| `third_party/prometheus` | `platform-prometheus` | Multiple subcomponents |
| `third_party/grafana/loki` | `platform-loki` | singleBinary mode |
| `third_party/langfuse` | `platform-langfuse` | web + worker subcharts |

---

## Success Criteria

1. **PR blocking** - Failed helm template blocks merge
2. **All envs tested** - dev, staging, production values validated
3. **Fast feedback** - < 5 minutes for full validation
4. **Clear errors** - Failure messages indicate exact issue

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| False positives | Blocked valid PRs | Allow `[skip-helm-test]` in commit message |
| Missing CRD schemas | Kubeconform failures | Download CRD schemas, or skip strict mode for CRDs |
| Slow CI | Developer frustration | Parallel jobs, caching |
| Third-party chart changes | Unexpected failures | Pin versions, separate job |

---

## Out of Scope

- **Runtime validation** - Covered by ArgoCD sync status
- **Security scanning** - Separate concern (Trivy, etc.)
- **Full deployment tests** - Requires live cluster

---

## Implementation Notes

### Workflow File: `.github/workflows/helm-test.yaml`

The workflow implements four jobs:

1. **discover-charts**: Finds all custom charts and charts with unit tests
2. **lint**: Runs `helm lint` on all custom charts
3. **unit-test**: Runs `helm unittest` on charts with `tests/*_test.yaml` files
4. **template-test**: Runs `helm template` with environment-specific values for dev/staging/production
5. **summary**: Aggregates results from all jobs

### Key Features

- **Path filters**: Only runs on changes to `sources/charts/**` or `sources/values/**`
- **Matrix testing**: Template tests run in parallel for all three environments
- **Skip non-charts**: Directories without `Chart.yaml` are skipped
- **Kubeconform validation**: Generated manifests are validated against K8s schemas
- **CRD skip list**: Custom resources (Application, Certificate, Kafka, etc.) are skipped in kubeconform

### Test Fixes Made

| Chart | Issue | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `agents` | Missing minio secret values | Use shared values file instead of inline values |
| `agents-runtime` | Missing minio secret values | Use shared values file instead of inline values |
| `vault-webhook-certs` | Template directive not working | Split into separate tests per template |
