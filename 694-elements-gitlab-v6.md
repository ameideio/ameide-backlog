# 694 – Elements / Enterprise Repository in GitLab (v6: Git-backed canonical content)

This v6 file exists to keep the v6 “Git-backed Enterprise Repository” posture stable and easy to reference from other backlogs.

To avoid losing detail, the full decision text (including the “How this evolves prior work” paragraphs and external links) is preserved in:

- `backlog/694-elements-gitlab.md` (historical record; superseded by this v6 pointer)

Normative cross-references for the v6 story:

- Integration/EDA posture: `backlog/496-eda-principles-v6.md`
- Runtime posture: `backlog/520-primitives-stack-v6.md`
- Transformation v6 spine: `backlog/527-transformation-v6-index.md`
